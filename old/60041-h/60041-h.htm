</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Here, by chance, in the early days of
December 1902, at the very spot where my book
begins, I am about to bring it to an end.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, coming hither from the higher
country at Silchester, where the trees were already
nearly bare, I was surprised to find the oak woods
of this lower southern part of the New Forest still in
their full autumnal foliage.  Even now, so late in the
year, after many successive days and nights of rain
and wind, they are in leaf still: everywhere the woods
are yellow, here where the oak predominates; the
stronger golden-red and russet tints of the beech are
vanished.  We have rain and wind on most days, or
rather mist and rain by day and wind with storms
of rain by night; days, too, or parts of days, when it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
is very dark and still, and when there is a universal
greyness in earth and sky.  At such times, seen against
the distant slaty darkness or in the blue-grey misty
atmosphere, the yellow woods look almost more
beautiful than in fine weather.
</p>

<p>
The wet woodland roads and paths are everywhere
strewn, and in places buried deep in fallen leaves&mdash;yellow,
red, and russet; and this colour is continued
under the trees all through the woods, where the
dead bracken has now taken that deep tint which
it will keep so long as there is rain or mist to wet
it for the next four or five months.  Dead bracken
with dead leaves on a reddish soil; and where the
woods are fir, the ground is carpeted with
lately-fallen needles of a chestnut red, which brightens
almost to orange in the rain.  Now, at this season, in
this universal redness of the earth where trees and
bracken grow, we see that Nature is justified in having
given that colour&mdash;red and reddish-yellow&mdash;to all or
to most of her woodland mammals.  Fox and foumart
and weasel and stoat; the hare too; the bright
squirrel; the dormouse and harvest-mouse; the
bank-vole and the wood-mouse.  Even the common
shrew and lesser shrew, though they rarely come out
by day, have a reddish tinge on their fur.  Water-shrew
and water-vole inhabit the banks of streams,
and are safer without such a colour; the dark grey
badger is strictly a night rover.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Autumn in the New Forest
</span>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes about noon the clouds grow thin in
that part of the sky, low down, where the sun is,
and a pale gleam of sunlight filters through; even a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
patch of lucid blue sky sometimes becomes visible for
a while: but the light soon fades; after mid-day the
dimness increases, and before long one begins to think
that evening has come.  Withal it is singularly
mild.  One could almost imagine in this season
of mist and wet and soft airs in late November
that this is a land where days grew short and dark
indeed, but where winter comes not, and the sensation
of cold is unknown.  It is pleasant to be out of
doors in such weather, to stand in the coloured woods
listening to that autumn sound of tits and other
little birds wandering through the high trees in
straggling parties, talking and calling to one another
in their small sharp voices.  Or to walk by the Boldre,
or, as some call it, the Lymington, a slow, tame
stream in summer, invisible till you are close to it;
but now, in flood, the trees that grow on its banks
and hid it in summer are seen standing deep in a
broad, rushing, noisy river.
</p>

<p>
The woodpecker's laugh has the same careless
happy sound as in summer: it is scarcely light in
the morning before the small wren pours out his
sharp bright lyric outside my window; it is time,
he tells me, to light my candle and get up.  The
starlings are about the house all day long, vocal
even in the rain, carrying on their perpetual starling
conversation&mdash;talk and song and recitative; a sort
of bird-Yiddish, with fluty fragments of melody
stolen from the blackbird, and whistle and click and
the music of the triangle thrown in to give variety.
So mild is it that in the blackness of night I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
sometimes wander into the forest paths and by furzy
heaths and hedges to listen for the delicate shrill
music of our late chirper in the thickets, our
<i>Thamnotrizon</i>, about which I shall write later; and look,
too, for a late glow-worm shining in some wet green
place.  Late in October I found one in daylight,
creeping about in the grass on Selborne Hill; and some
few, left unmarried, may shine much later.  And as to
the shade-loving grasshopper or leaf cricket, he sings,
we know, on mild evenings in November.  But I
saw no green lamp in the herbage, and I heard
only that nightly music of the tawny owl, fluting
and hallooing far and near, bird answering bird in
the oak woods all along the swollen stream from
Brockenhurst to Boldre.
</p>

<p>
This race of wood owls perhaps have exceptionally
strong voices: Wise, in his book on the New Forest,
says that their hooting can be heard on a still autumn
evening a distance of two miles.  I have no doubt
they can be heard a good mile.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A house by the Boldre
</span>
</p>

<p>
But it is of this, to a bird lover, delectable spot in
the best bird-months of April, May, and June that I
have to write.  The house, too, that gave me shelter
must be spoken of; for never have I known any
human habitation, in a land where people are
discovered dwelling in so many secret, green,
out-of-the-world places, which had so much of nature in
and about it.  Grown-up and young people were in
it, and children too, but they were girls, and had
always quite spontaneously practised what I had
preached&mdash;pet nothing and persecute nothing.  There
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
was no boy to disturb the wild creatures with his
hunting instincts and loud noises; no dog, no cat,
nor any domestic creature except the placid cows
and fowls which supplied the household with milk
and eggs.  A small old picturesque red-brick house
with high-pitched roof and tall chimneys, a great
part of it overrun with ivy and creepers, the walls
and tiled roof stained by time and many-coloured
lichen to a richly variegated greyish red.  The date
of the house, cut in a stone tablet in one of the
rooms, was 1692.  In front there was no lawn, but
a walled plot of ground with old, once ornamental
trees and bushes symmetrically placed&mdash;yews, both
spreading and cypress-shaped Irish yew, and tall
tapering juniper, and arbor vitæ; it was a sort
of formal garden which had long thrown off its
formality.  In a corner of the ground by the side
of these dark plants were laurel, syringa, and lilac
bushes, and among these such wildings as thorn,
elder and bramble had grown up, flourishing greatly,
and making of that flowery spot a tangled thicket.
At the side of the house there was another plot
of ground, grass-grown, which had once been the
orchard, and still had a few ancient apple and pear
trees, nearly past bearing, with good nesting-holes
for the tits and starlings in their decayed mossy
trunks.  There were also a few old ivied
shade-trees&mdash;chestnuts, fir, and evergreen oak.
</p>

<p>
Best of all (for the birds) were the small old
half-ruined outhouses which had remained from the
distant days when the place, originally a manor,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
had been turned into a farm-house.  They were
here and there, scattered about, outside the
enclosure, ivy-grown, each looking as old and
weather-stained and in harmony with its surroundings as
the house itself&mdash;the small tumble-down barns, the
cow-sheds, the pig-house, the granary with open
door and the wooden staircase falling to pieces.  All
was surrounded by old oak woods, and the river was
close by.  It was an ideal spot for small birds.  I have
never in England seen so many breeding close
together.  The commoner species were extraordinarily
abundant.  Chaffinch and greenfinch; blackbird,
throstle and missel-thrush; swallow and martin, and
common and lesser whitethroat; garden warbler and
blackcap; robin, dunnock, wren, flycatcher, pied
wagtail, starling, and sparrow;&mdash;one could go round
and put one's hand into half a dozen nests of almost
any of these species.  And very many of them had
become partial to the old buildings: even in closed
rooms where it was nearly dark, not only wrens,
robins, tits, and wagtails, but blackbirds and throstles
and chaffinches were breeding, building on beams and
in or on the old nests of swallows and martins.  The
hawfinch and bullfinch were also there, the last
rearing its brood within eight yards of the front door.
One of his two nearest neighbours was a gold-crested
wren.  When the minute bird was sitting on her
eggs, in her little cradle-nest suspended to a spray
of the yew, every day I would pull the branch down
so that we might all enjoy the sight of the little fairy
bird in her fairy nest which she refused to quit.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
other next-door neighbour of the bullfinch was the
long-tailed tit, which built its beautiful little nest
on a terminal spray of another yew, ten or twelve
yards from the door; and this small creature would
also let us pull the branch down and peep into her
well-feathered interior.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Abundance of nests
</span>
</p>

<p>
It seemed that, from long immunity from persecution,
all these small birds had quite lost their fear of
human beings; but in late May and in June, when
many young birds were out of the nest, one had to
walk warily in the grass for fear of putting a foot on
some little speckled creature patiently waiting to be
visited and fed by its parents.
</p>

<p>
Nor were there birds only.  Little beasties were
also quite abundant; but they were of species that
did no harm (at all events there), and the weasel
would come from time to time to thin them down.
Money is paid to mole-catcher and rat-catcher; the
weasel charges you nothing: he takes it out in kind.
And even as the jungle tiger, burning bright, and the
roaring lion strike with panic the wild cattle and
antelopes and herds of swine, so does this miniature
carnivore, this fairy tiger of English homesteads and
hedges, fill with trepidation the small deer he hunts
and slays with his needle teeth&mdash;Nature's scourge
sent out among her too prolific small rodents; her
little blood-letter who relieves her and restores the
balance.  And therefore he, too, with his flat serpent
head and fiery killing soul, is a "dear" creature,
being, like the poet's web-footed beasts of an earlier
epoch, "part of a general plan."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
</p>

<p>
The most abundant of the small furred creatures
were the two short-tailed voles&mdash;field-vole and bank-vole;
the last, in his bright chestnut-red, the prettiest.
Whenever I sat down for a few minutes in the porch
I would see one or more run across the stones from
one side, where masses of periwinkle grew against
the house, to the other side, where Virginia creeper,
rose, and an old magnolia tree covered the wall.
One day at the back of the house by the scullery
door I noticed a swaying movement in a tall seeded
stem of dock, and looking down spied a wee harvest-mouse
running and climbing nimbly on the slender
branchlets, feeding daintily on the seed, and looking
like a miniature squirrel on a miniature bush.
</p>

<p>
Just there, close to the door, was a wood-pile, and
the hornets had made their nest in it.  The year
before they had made it in a loft in the house, and
before that in the old barn.  The splendid insects
were coming and going all day, interfering with
nobody and nobody interfering with them; and
when I put a plate of honey for them on the logs
close to their entrance they took no notice of it;
but by-and-by bank-voles and wood-mice came
stealing out from among the logs and fed on it until
it was all gone.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised, and could only suppose that the
hornets did not notice or discover the honey, because
no such good thing was looked for so close to their
door.  Away from home the hornet was quick to
discover anything sweet to the taste, and very ready to
resent the presence of any other creature at the table.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hornet and bank-vole
</span>
</p>

<p>
At the riverside, a few hundred yards from the
house, I was sitting in the shade of a large elm tree
one day when I was visited by a big hornet, who
swept noisily down and settled on the trunk, four
or five feet above the ground.  A quantity of sap
had oozed out into a deep cleft of the rough bark
and had congealed there, and the hornet had
discovered it.  Before he had been long feeding on it
I saw a little bank-vole come out from the roots of
the tree and run up the trunk, looking very pretty
in his bright chestnut fur as he came into the
sunlight.  Stealing up to the lower end of the cleft full
of thickened sap he too began feeding on it.  The
hornet, who was at the upper end of the cleft, quite
four inches apart from the vole, at once stopped
eating and regarded the intruder for some time, then
advanced towards him in a threatening attitude.
The vole was frightened at this, starting and erecting
his hair, and once or twice he tried to recover his
courage and resume his feeding, but the hornet still
keeping up his hostile movements, he eventually
slipped quietly down and hid himself at the roots.
When the hornet departed he came out again and
went to the sap.
</p>

<p>
Wishing to see more, I spent most of that day and
the day following at the spot, and saw hornet and
vole meet many times.  If the vole was at the sap
when the hornet came he was at once driven off,
and when the hornet was there first the vole was
never allowed to feed, although on every occasion
he tried to do so, stealing to his lower place in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
gentlest way in order not to give offence, and after
beginning to feed affecting not to see that the other
had left off eating, and with raised head was regarding
him with jealous eyes.
</p>

<p>
Rarely have I looked on a prettier little comedy
in wild life.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the house.  There was quite a
happy family at that spot by the back door where
the hornets were.  A numerous family of shrews
were reared, and the young, when they began
exploring the world, used to creep over the white stone
by the threshold.  The girls would pick them up to
feel their soft mole-like fur: the young shrew is a
gentle creature and does not attempt to bite.  Some
of the more adventurous ones were always blundering
into the empty flowerpots heaped against the wall,
and there they would remain imprisoned until some
person found and took them out.
</p>

<p>
One morning, at half-past four o'clock, when I
was lying awake listening to the blackbird, a lively
squirrel came dancing into the open window of
my bedroom on the first floor.  There were writing
materials, flowers in glasses, and other objects on
the ledge and dressing-table there, and he frisked
about among them, chattering, wildly excited at
seeing so many curious and pretty things, but he
upset nothing; and by-and-by he danced out again
into the ivy covering the wall on that side, throwing
the colony of breeding sparrows into a great state
of consternation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Drumming of woodpecker
</span>
</p>

<p>
The river was quite near the house&mdash;not half a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
minute from the front door, though hidden from
sight by the trees on its banks.  Here, at the nearest
point, there was an old half-dead dwarf oak growing
by the water and extending one horizontal branch
a distance of twenty feet over the stream.  This was
the favourite drumming-tree of a green woodpecker,
and at intervals through the day he would visit it
and drum half a dozen times or so.  This drumming
sounded so loud that, following the valley down,
I measured the distance it could be heard and found
it just one-third of a mile.  At that distance I could
hear it distinctly; farther on, not at all.  It seemed
almost incredible that the sound produced by so
small a stick as a woodpecker's beak striking a tree
should be audible at that distance.
</p>

<p>
It is hardly to be doubted that the drumming is
used as a love-call, though it is often heard in late
summer.  It is, however, in early spring and in the
breeding season that it is oftenest heard, and I have
found that a good imitation of it will sometimes
greatly excite the bird.  The same bird may be heard
drumming here, there, and everywhere in a wood
or copse, the sound varying somewhat in character
and strength according to the wood; but each bird
as a rule has a favourite drumming-tree, and it
probably angers him to hear another bird at the
spot.  On one occasion, finding that a very large,
old, and apparently dying cedar in a wood was
constantly used by the woodpecker, I went to the
spot and imitated the sound.  Very soon the bird
came and begun drumming against me, close by.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
I responded, and again he drummed; and becoming
more and more excited he flew close to me, and passing
from tree to tree drummed at every spot he lighted on.
</p>

<p>
The other species have the same habit of drumming
on one tree.  I have noticed it in the small spotted,
or banded, woodpecker; and have observed that
invariably after he has drummed two or three times
the female has come flying to him from some other
part of the wood, and the two birds have then both
together uttered their loud chirping notes and
flown away.
</p>

<p>
On revisiting the spot a year after I had heard the
green woodpecker drumming every day in the oak by
the river, I found that he had forsaken it, and that
close by, on the other side of the stream, a great
spotted woodpecker had selected as his drumming-tree
a very big elm growing on the bank.  He drummed
on a large dead branch about forty feet from the
ground, and the sound he made was quite as loud as
that of the green bird.  It may be that the two big
woodpeckers, who play equally well on the same
instrument, are intolerant of one another's presence,
and that in this case the spotted bird had driven
the larger yaffle from his territory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Our handsomest bird
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the prettiest spots by the water was that
very one where the spotted bird was accustomed to
come, and I often went there at noon and sat for an
hour on the grassy bank in the shade of the
drumming-tree.  The river was but thirty to forty feet
wide at that spot, with masses of water forget-me-not
growing on the opposite bank, clearly reflected
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
in the sherry-coloured sunlit current below.  The
trees were mostly oaks, in the young vivid green
of early June foliage.  And one day when the sky,
seen through that fresh foliage, was without a stain
of vapour in its pure azure, when the wood was full
of clear sunlight&mdash;so clear that silken spider webs,
thirty or forty feet high in the oaks, were visible as
shining red and blue and purple lines&mdash;the bird,
after drumming high above my head, flew to an oak
tree just before me, and clinging vertically to the
bark on the high part of the trunk, remained there
motionless for some time.  His statuesque attitude,
as he sat with his head thrown well back, the light
glinting on his hard polished feathers, black and
white and crimson, the setting in which he appeared
of greenest translucent leaves and hoary bark and
open sunlit space, all together made him seem not
only our handsomest woodpecker, but our most
beautiful bird.  I had seen him at his best, and sitting
there motionless amid the wind-fluttered leaves, he
was like a bird-figure carved from some beautiful
vari-coloured stone.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The most interesting events in animal life observed
at this spot relate to the cuckoo in the spring of 1900.
Some time before this Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace said,
in the course of a talk we had, that he very much
wanted me to find out exactly what happened in a
nest in which a young cuckoo was hatched.  It was,
I replied, an old, old story&mdash;what could I see,
supposing I was lucky enough to find a nest where I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
could observe it properly, more than Jenner,
Hancock, Mrs. Hugh Blackburn, and perhaps other
writers, had told us?  Yes, it was an old story,
he said, and he wanted it told again by someone
else.  People had lately been discrediting Jenner's
account, and as to the other chief authority I had
named, one writer, a Dr. Creighton, had said, "As
for artists like Mrs. Blackburn, they can draw what
they please&mdash;all out of their own brains: we can't
trust them, or such as them."  Sober-minded
naturalists had come to regard the habit and abnormal
strength attributed to the newly-hatched cuckoo as
"not proven" or quite incredible; thus Seebohm had
said, "One feels inclined to class these narratives
with the equally well-authenticated stories of ghosts
and other apparitions which abound."
</p>

<p>
Since my conversation with Dr. Wallace we have
had more of these strange narratives&mdash;the fables and
ghost stories which the unbelievers are compelled in
the end to accept&mdash;and all that Dr. Jenner or his
assistant saw others have seen, and some observers
have even taken snapshots of the young cuckoo in
the act of ejecting his fellow-nestling.  But it appears
from all the accounts which I have so far read, that
in every case the observer was impatient and
interfered in the business by touching and irritating the
young cuckoo, by putting eggs and other objects on
his back, and by making other experiments.  In the
instance I am about to give there was no
interference by me or by the others who at intervals
watched with me.

<span class="sidenote">
A cuckoo in a robin's nest
</span>
</p>

<p>
A robin's nest with three robin's eggs and one of
the cuckoo was found in a low bank at the side of
the small orchard on 19th May, 1900.  The bird was
incubating, and on the afternoon of 27th May the
cuckoo hatched out.  Unfortunately I did not know
how long incubation had been going on before the
19th, but from the fact that the cuckoo was first
out, it seems probable that the parasite has this
further advantage of coming first from the shell.
Long ago I found that this was so in the case of
the parasitical troupials of the genus <i>Molothrus</i> in
South America.
</p>

<p>
I kept a close watch on the nest for the rest of
that afternoon and the whole of the following day
(the 28th), during which the young cuckoo was
lying in the bottom of the nest, helpless as a piece
of jelly with a little life in it, and with just strength
enough in his neck to lift his head and open his
mouth; and then, after a second or two, the wavering
head would drop again.  At eight o'clock next morning
(29th), I found that one robin had come out of the
shell, and one egg had been ejected and was lying
a few inches below the nest on the sloping bank.
Yet the young cuckoo still appeared a weak, helpless,
jelly-like creature, as on the previous day.  But
he had increased greatly in size.  I believe that in
forty-eight hours from the time of hatching he had
quite doubled his bulk, and had grown darker, his
naked skin being of a bluish-black colour.  The
robin, thirty or more hours younger, was little more
than half his size, and had a pale, pinkish-yellow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
skin, thinly clothed with a long black down.  The
cuckoo occupied the middle of the deep, cup-shaped
nest, and his broad back, hollow in the middle,
formed a sort of false bottom; but there was a small
space between the bird's sides and the nest, and in
this space or interstice the one unhatched egg that
still remained and the young robin were lying.
</p>

<p>
During this day (29th) I observed that the pressure
of the egg and young robin against his sides irritated
the cuckoo: he was continually moving, jerking and
wriggling his lumpish body this way and that, as if
to get away from the contact.  At intervals this
irritation would reach its culminating point, and a
series of mechanical movements would begin, all
working blindly but as surely towards the end as
if some devilish intelligence animated the seemingly
helpless infant parasite.
</p>

<p>
Of the two objects in the nest the unhatched egg
irritated him the most.  The young robin was soft,
it yielded when pressed, and could be made somehow
to fit into the interstice; but the hard, round
shell, pressing against him like a pebble, was torture
to him, and at intervals became unendurable.  Then
would come that magical change in him, when he
seemed all at once to become possessed of a
preternatural power and intelligence, and then the blind
struggle down in the nest would begin.  And after
each struggle&mdash;each round it might be called&mdash;the
cuckoo would fall back again and lie in a state of
collapse, as if the mysterious virtue had gone out of
him.  But in a very short time the pressure on his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
side would begin again to annoy him, then to torment
him, and at last he would be wrought up to a fresh
effort.  Thus in a space of eight minutes I saw him
struggle four separate times, with a period of collapse
after each, to get rid of the robin's egg; and each
struggle involved a long series of movements on his
part.  On each of these occasions the egg was pushed
or carried up to the wrong or upper side of the nest,
with the result that when the bird jerked the egg
from him it rolled back into the bottom of the nest.
The statement is therefore erroneous that the cuckoo
knows at which side to throw the egg out.  Of course
he <i>knows</i> nothing, and, as a fact, he tries to throw
the egg up as often as down the slope.
</p>

<p>
The process in each case was as follows: The
pressure of the egg against the cuckoo's side, as I
have said, was a constant irritation; but the irritability
varied in degree in different parts of the body.
On the under parts it scarcely existed; its seat was
chiefly on the upper surface, beginning at the sides
and increasing towards the centre, and was greatest
in the hollow of the back.  When, in moving, the
egg got pushed up to the upper edge of his side, he
would begin to fidget more and more, and this would
cause it to move round, and so to increase the
irritation by touching and pressing against other parts.
When all the bird's efforts to get away from the
object had only made matters worse, he would cease
wriggling and squat down lower and lower in the
bottom of the nest, and the egg, forced up, would
finally roll right into the cavity in his back&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
most irritable part of all.  Whenever this occurred,
a sudden change that was like a fit would seize the
bird; he would stiffen, rise in the nest, his flabby
muscles made rigid, and stand erect, his back in a
horizontal position, the head hanging down, the
little naked wings held up over the back.  In that
position he looked an ugly, lumpish negro mannikin,
standing on thinnest dwarf legs, his back bent, and
elbows stuck up above the hollow flat back.
</p>

<p>
Once up on his small stiffened legs he would move
backwards, firmly grasping the hairs and hair-like
fibres of the nest-lining, and never swerving, until
the rim of the cup-like structure was reached; and
then standing, with feet sometimes below and in
some cases on the rim, he would jerk his body,
throwing the egg off or causing it to roll off.  After
that he would fall back into the nest and lie quite
exhausted for some time, his jelly-like body rising
and falling with his breathing.
</p>

<p>
These changes in the bird strongly reminded me
of a person with an epileptic fit, as I had been
accustomed to see it on the pampas, where, among the
gauchos, epilepsy is one of the commonest maladies;&mdash;the
sudden rigidity of muscle in some weak, sickly,
flabby-looking person, the powerful grip of the hand,
the strength in struggling, exceeding that of a man
in perfect health, and finally, when this state is over,
the weakness of complete exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
I witnessed several struggles with the egg, but at
last, in spite of my watchfulness, I did not see it
ejected.  On returning after a very short absence,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
I found the egg had been thrown out and had rolled
down the bank, a distance of fourteen inches from
the nest.
</p>

<p>
The young cuckoo appeared to rest more quietly
in the nest now, but after a couple of hours the old
fidgeting began again, and increased until he was in
the same restless state as before.  The rapid growth
of the birds made the position more and more miserable
for the cuckoo, since the robin, thrust against
the side of the nest, would throw his head and neck
across the cuckoo's back, and he could not endure
being touched there.  And now a fresh succession of
struggles began, the whole process being just the
same as when the egg was struggled with.  But it
was not so easy with the young bird, not because
of its greater weight, but because it did not roll
like the egg and settle in the middle of the back;
it would fall partly on to the cuckoo's back and then
slip off into the nest again.  But success came at
last, after many failures.  The robin was lying partly
across the cuckoo's neck, when, in moving its head,
its little curved beak came down and rested on the
very centre of that irritable hollow in the back of
its foster-brother.  Instantly the cuckoo pressed down
into the nest, shrinking away as if hot needles had
pricked him, as far as possible from the side where
the robin was lying against him, and this movement
of course brought the robin more and more over him,
until he was thrown right upon the cuckoo's back.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the rigid fit came on, and up rose the
cuckoo, as if the robin weighed no more than a feather
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
on him; and away backwards he went, right up the
nest, without a pause, and standing actually on the
rim, jerked his body, causing the robin to fall off,
clean away from the nest.  It fell, in fact, on to a
large dock leaf five inches below the rim of the nest,
and rested there.
</p>

<p>
After getting rid of his burden the cuckoo
continued in the same position, perfectly rigid, for a
space of five or six seconds, during which it again
and again violently jerked its body, as if it had the
feeling of the burden on it still.  Then, the fit over,
it fell back, exhausted as usual.
</p>

<p>
I had been singularly fortunate in witnessing the
last scene and conclusion of this little bloodless
tragedy in a bird's nest, with callow nestlings for
<i>dramatis personæ</i>, this innocent crime and wrong,
which is not a wrong since the cuckoo doesn't think
it one.  It is a little curious to reflect that a similar
act takes place annually in tens of thousands of
small birds' nests all over the country, and that
it is so rarely witnessed.
</p>

<p>
Marvellous as the power of the young cuckoo is
when the fit is on him, it is of course limited, and
when watching his actions I concluded that it would
be impossible for him to eject eggs and nestlings
from any thrush's nest.  The blackbird's would be
too deep, and as to the throstle's, he could not move
backwards up the sides of the cup-like cavity on
account of the smooth plastered surface.
</p>

<p>
After having seen the young robin cast out I still
refrained from touching the nest, as there were yet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
other things to observe.  One was the presence, very
close to the nest, of the ejected nestling&mdash;what would
the parents do in the case?  Before dealing with
that matter I shall conclude the history of the
young cuckoo.
</p>

<p>
Having got the nest to himself he rested very
quietly, and it was not till the following day (1st
July) that I allowed myself to touch him.  He was,
I found, still irritable, and when I put back the eggs
he had thrown out he was again miserable in the
nest, and the struggle with the eggs was renewed
until he got rid of them as before.  The next day
the irritability had almost gone, and in the
afternoon he suffered an egg or a pebble to remain in the
nest with him without jerking and wriggling about,
and he made no further attempt to eject it.  This
observation&mdash;the loss of irritability on the fifth
day after hatching&mdash;agrees with that of Mr. Craig,
whose account was printed in the <i>Feathered World</i>,
14th July, 1899.
</p>

<p>
The young cuckoo grew rapidly and soon trod his
nest into a broad platform, on which he reposed, a
conspicuous object in the scanty herbage on the bank.
We often visited and fed him, when he would puff
up his plumage and strike savagely at our hands,
but at the same time he would always gobble down
the food we offered.  In seventeen days after being
hatched he left the nest and took up his position
in an oak tree growing on the bank, and there the
robins continued feeding him for the next three days,
after which we saw no more of him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
</p>

<p>
I may add that in May 1901 a pair of robins built
on the bank close to where the nest had been made
the previous year, and that in this nest a cuckoo was
also reared.  The bird, when first seen, was apparently
about four or five days old, and it had the nest to
itself.  Three ejected robin's eggs were lying on the
bank a little lower down.
</p>

<p>
It is hardly to be doubted that the robins were
the same birds that had reared the cuckoo in the
previous season; and it is highly probable that
the same cuckoo had returned to place her egg in
their nest.
</p>

<p>
The end of the little history&mdash;the fate of the ejected
nestling and the attitude of the parent robins&mdash;remains
to be told.  When the young cuckoo throws
out the nestlings from nests in trees, hedges, bushes,
and reeds, the victims, as a rule, fall some distance
to the ground, or in the water, and are no more seen
by the old birds.  Here the young robin, when ejected,
fell a distance of but five or six inches, and rested on
a broad, bright green leaf, where it was an exceedingly
conspicuous object; and when the mother robin was
on the nest&mdash;and at this stage she was on it a greater
part of the time&mdash;warming that black-skinned,
toad-like, spurious babe of hers, her bright, intelligent
eyes were looking full at the other one, just beneath
her, which she had grown in her body and had
hatched with her warmth, and was her very own.
I watched her for hours; watched her when warming
the cuckoo, when she left the nest and when she
returned with food, and warmed it again, and never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
once did she pay the least attention to the outcast
lying there so close to her.  There, on its green leaf,
it remained, growing colder by degrees, hour by hour,
motionless, except when it lifted its head as if to
receive food, then dropped it again, and when, at
intervals, it twitched its body as if trying to move.
During the evening even these slight motions ceased,
though that feeblest flame of life was not yet
extinguished; but in the morning it was dead and cold and
stiff; and just above it, her bright eyes on it, the
mother robin sat on the nest as before, warming
her cuckoo.
</p>

<p>
How amazing and almost incredible it seems that
a being such as a robin, intelligent above most birds
as we are apt to think, should prove in this instance
to be a mere automaton!  The case would, I think,
have been different if the ejected one had made a
sound, since there is nothing which more excites the
parent bird, or which is more instantly responded to,
than the cry of hunger or distress of the young.  But
at this early stage the nestling is voiceless&mdash;another
point in favour of the parasite.  The sight of its
young, we see, slowly and dumbly dying, touches no
chord in the parent: there is, in fact, no recognition;
once out of the nest it is no more than a coloured
leaf, or a bird-shaped pebble, or fragment of clay.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It happened that my young fellow-watchers, seeing
that the ejected robin if left there would inevitably
perish, proposed to take it in to feed and rear it&mdash;to
save it, as they said; but I advised them not to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
attempt such a thing, but rather to spare the bird.
To spare it the misery they would inflict upon it by
attempting to fill its parents' place.  They had, so
far, never kept a caged bird, nor a pet bird, and had
no desire to keep one; all they desired to do in this
case was to save the little outcast from death&mdash;to
rear it till it was able to fly away and take care of
itself.  That was a difficult, a well-nigh impossible
task.  The bird, at this early stage, required to be
fed at short intervals for about sixteen hours each
day on a peculiar kind of food, suited to its delicate
stomach&mdash;chiefly small caterpillars found in the
herbage; and it also needed a sufficient amount
by day and night of that animal warmth which
only the parent bird could properly supply.  They,
not being robins, would give it unsuitable food, feed
it at improper times, and not keep it at the right
temperature, with the almost certain result that after
lingering a few days it would die in their hands.
But if by giving a great deal of time and much care
they should succeed in rearing it, their foundling
would start his independent life so handicapped,
weakened in constitution by an indoor artificial
bringing up, without the training which all young
birds receive from their parents after quitting the
nest, that it would be impossible for him to save
himself.  If by chance he should survive until August,
he would then be set upon and killed by one of the
adult robins already in possession of the ground.
Now, when a bird at maturity perishes, it suffers in
dying&mdash;sometimes very acutely; but if left to grow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
cold and fade out of life at this stage it can hardly
be said to suffer.  It is no more conscious than a chick
in the shell; take from it the warmth that keeps it
in being, and it drops back into nothingness without
knowing and, we may say, without feeling anything.
There may indeed be an incipient consciousness in
that small, soft brain in its early vegetative stage, a
first faint glimmer of bright light to be, and a slight
sensation of numbness may be actually felt as the
body grows cold, but that would be all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mistaken kindness
</span>
</p>

<p>
Pain is so common in the world; and, owing to
the softness and sensitiveness induced in us by an
indoor artificial life&mdash;since that softness of our bodies
reacts on our minds&mdash;we have come to a false or an
exaggerated idea of its importance, its <i>painfulness</i>,
to put it that way; and we should therefore be but
making matters worse, or rather making ourselves
more miserable, by looking for and finding it where
it does not exist.
</p>

<p>
The power to feel pain in any great degree comes
into the bird's life after this transitional period, and
is greatest at maturity, when consciousness and all
the mental faculties are fully developed, particularly
the passion of fear, which plays continually on the
strings of the wild creature's heart with an ever
varying touch, producing the feeling in all degrees
from the slight disquiet, which is no sooner come
than gone, to extremities of agonising terror.  It
would perhaps have a wholesome effect on their
young minds, and save them from grieving over-much
at the death of a newly-hatched robin, if they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
would consider this fact of the pain that is and must
be.  Not the whole subject&mdash;the fact that as things
are designed in this world of sentient life there can
be no good, no sweetness or pleasure in life, nor
peace and contentment and safety, nor happiness
and joy, nor any beauty or strength or lustre, nor
any bright and shining quality of body or mind,
without pain, which is not an accident nor an
incident, nor something ancillary to life, but is involved
in and a part of life, of its very colour and texture.
That would be too long to speak about; all I meant
was to consider that small part of the fact, the
necessary pain to and destruction of the bird life
around them and in the country generally.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Annual bird-mortality
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here, for instance, without going farther than a
hundred yards from the house in any direction, they
could put their hands in nests in trees and bushes,
and on the ground, and in the ivy, and in the old
outhouse, and handle and count about one hundred
and thirty young birds not yet able to fly.  Probably
more than twice that number would be successfully
reared during the season.  How many, then, would be
reared in the whole parish!  How many in the entire
New Forest district, in the whole county of
Hampshire, in the entire kingdom!  Yet when summer
came round again they would find no more birds
than they had now.  And so it would be in all places;
all that incalculable increase would have perished.
Many millions would be devoured by rapacious birds
and beasts; millions more would perish of hunger
and cold; millions of migrants would fall by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
way, some in the sea and some on land; those
that returned from distant regions would be but a
remnant, and the residents that survived through
the winter, these, too, would be nothing but a
remnant.  It is not only that this inconceivable
amount of bird life must be destroyed each year,
but we cannot suppose that death is not a painful
process.  In a vast majority of cases, whether the
bird slowly perishes of hunger and weakness, or is
pursued and captured by birds and beasts of prey,
or is driven by cold adverse winds and storms into
the waves, the pain, the agony must be great.  The
least painful death is undoubtedly that of the bird
that, weakened by want of sustenance, dies by night
of cold in severe weather.  It is indeed most like
the death of the nestling, but a few hours out of
the shell, which has been thrown out of the nest,
and which soon grows cold, and dozes its feeble,
unconscious life away.
</p>

<p>
We may say, then, that of all the thousand forms
of death which Nature has invented to keep her too
rapidly multiplying creatures within bounds, that
which is brought about by the singular instinct of
the young cuckoo in the nest is the most merciful
or the least painful.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure that I said all this, or marshalled
fact and argument in the precise order in which
they are here set down.  I fancy not, as it seems
more than could well have been spoken while we
were standing there in the late evening sunlight
by that primrose bank, looking down on the little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
flesh-coloured mite in its scant clothing of black
down, fading out of life on its cold green leaf.  But
what was said did not fail of its effect, so that my
young tender-hearted hearers, who had begun to
listen with moist eyes, secretly accusing me perhaps
of want of feeling, were content in the end to let it
be&mdash;to go away and leave it to its fate in that
mysterious green world we, too, live in and do not
understand, in which life and death and pleasure
and pain are interwoven light and shade.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Between the Boldre and the Exe, or Beaulieu
river, there is a stretch of country in most part
flat and featureless.  It is one of those parts
of the Forest which have a bare and desolate aspect;
here in places you can go a mile and not find a tree
or bush, where nothing grows but a starved-looking
heath, scarcely ankle-deep.  Wild life in such places
is represented by a few meadow-pipits and small
lizards.  There is no doubt that this barrenness and
naked appearance is the result of the perpetual
cutting of heath and gorse, and the removal of the
thin surface soil for fuel.
</p>

<p>
Those who do not know the New Forest, or know
it only as a collecting- or happy hunting-ground of
eggers and "lepidopterists," or as artists in search
of paintable woodland scenery know it, and others
who make it a summer holiday resort, may say that
this abuse is one which might and should be remedied.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
They would be mistaken.  What I and a few others
who use their senses see and hear in this or that spot,
is, in every case, a very small matter, a visible but
an infinitesimal part of that abuse of the New Forest
which is old and chronic, and operates always, and
is common to the whole area, and, as things are,
irremediable.  To discover and denounce certain
things which ought not to be, to rail against
verderers, who are after all what they cannot help
being, is about as profitable as it would be to "damn
the nature of things."
</p>

<p>
It must be borne in mind that the Forest area has
a considerable population composed of commoners,
squatters, private owners, who have inherited or
purchased lands originally filched from the Forest;
and of a large number of persons who reside mostly
in the villages, and are private residents, publicans,
shopkeepers, and lodging-house keepers.  All these
people have one object in common&mdash;to get as much
as they can out of the Forest.  It is true that a large
proportion of them, especially those who live in the
villages, which are now rapidly increasing their
populations, are supposed not to have any Forest
rights; but they do as a fact get something out of
it; and we may say that, generally, all the people
in the Forest dine at one table, and all get a helping
out of most of the dishes going, though the first and
biggest helpings are for the favoured guests.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
New Forest conscience
</span>
</p>

<p>
Those who have inherited rights have indeed come
to look on the Forest as in a sense their property.
What is given or handed over to them is not in their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
view their proper share: they take this openly, and
get the balance the best way they can&mdash;in the dark
generally.  It is not dishonest to help yourself to
what belongs to you; and they must live&mdash;must
have their whack.  They have, in fact, their own
moral code, their New Forest conscience, just as
other men&mdash;miners, labourers on the land, tradesmen,
gamekeepers, members of the Stock Exchange, for
instance&mdash;have each their corporate code and
conscience.  It may not be the general or the ideal or
speculative conscience, but it is what may be called
their working conscience.  One proof that much goes
on in the dark, or that much is winked at, is the
paucity of all wild life which is worth any man's
while to take in a district where pretty well
everything is protected on paper.  Game, furred and
feathered, would not exist at all but for the private
estates scattered through the Forest, in which game
is preserved, and from which the depleted Forest
lands are constantly being restocked.  Again, in all
this most favourable country no rare or beautiful
species may be found: it would be safer for the hobby,
the golden oriole, the hoopoe, the harrier, to nest in
a metropolitan park than in the loneliest wood
between the Avon and Southampton Water.  To
introduce any new species, from the biggest&mdash;the
capercailzie and the great bustard&mdash;to the smallest
quail, or any small passerine bird with a spot of
brilliant colour on its plumage, would be impossible.
</p>

<p>
The New Forest people are, in fact, just what
circumstances have made them.  Like all organised
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
beings, they are the creatures of, and subject to,
the conditions they exist in; and they cannot be
other than they are&mdash;namely, parasites on the Forest.
And, what is more, they cannot be educated, or
preached, or worried out of their ingrained parasitical
habits and ways of thought.  They have had centuries&mdash;long
centuries&mdash;of practice to make them cunning,
and the effect of more stringent regulations than
those now in use would only be to polish and put a
better edge on that weapon which Nature has given
them to fight with.
</p>

<p>
This being the conclusion, namely, that "things
are what they are, and the consequences of them
will be what they will be," some of my readers,
especially those in the New Forest, may ask, Why,
then, say anything about it? why not follow the
others who have written books and books and books
about the New Forest, books big and books little,
from Wise, his classic, and the Victoria History,
down to the long row of little rosy guide-books?
They saw nothing of all this; or if they saw
un-pleasant things they thought it better to hold their
tongues, or pens, than to make people uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
I confess it would be a mistake, a mere waste of
words, to bring these hidden things to light if it
could be believed that the New Forest, in its
condition and management, will continue for any length
of time to be what it is and has been&mdash;just that and
nothing more.  A district in England, it is true, but
out of the way, remote, a spot to be visited once
or twice in a lifetime just to look at the scenery,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
like Lundy or the Scilly Isles or the Orkneys.  But
it cannot be believed.  The place itself, its curious
tangle of ownership&mdash;government by and rights of
the crown, of private owners, commoners, and the
public&mdash;is what it has always been; but many persons
have now come to think and to believe that the time
is approaching when there will be a disentanglement
and a change.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A change foreshadowed
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Forest has been known and loved by a limited
number of persons always; the general public have
only discovered it in recent years.  For one visitor
twenty years ago there are scores, probably hundreds,
to-day.  And year by year, as motoring becomes
more common, and as cycling from being general
grows, as it will, to be universal, the flow of visitors
to the Forest will go on at an ever-increasing rate,
and the hundreds of to-day will be thousands in
five years' time.  With these modern means of
locomotion, there is no more attractive spot than this
hundred and fifty square miles of level country
which contains the most beautiful forest scenery in
England.  And as it grows in favour in all the country
as a place of recreation and refreshment, the subject
of its condition and management, and the ways of its
inhabitants, will receive an increased attention.  The
desire will grow that it shall not be spoilt, either by
the authorities or the residents, that it shall not
be turned into townships and plantations, nor be
starved, nor its wild life left to be taken and destroyed
by anyone and everyone.  It will be seen that the
"rights" I have spoken of, with the unwritten laws
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
and customs which are kept more or less in the dark,
are in conflict with the better and infinitely more
important rights of the people generally&mdash;of the
whole nation.  Once all this becomes common
knowledge, that which some now regard as a mere dream,
a faint hope, something too remote for us to concern
ourselves about, will all at once appear to us as a
practical object&mdash;something to be won by fighting,
and certainly worth fighting for.
</p>

<p>
It may be said at once, and I fancy that anyone
who knows the inner life of the Forest people will
agree with me, that so long as these are in possession
(and here all private owners are included) there can
be no great change, no permanent improvement
made in the Forest.  That is the difficulty, but it is
not an insuperable one.  Public opinion, and the
desire of the people for anything, is a considerable
force to-day; so that, inspired by it, the most timid
and conservative governments are apt all at once to
acquire an extraordinary courage.  Sustained by that
outside force, the most tender-hearted and sensitive
Prime Minister would not in the least mind if some
persons were to dub him a second and worse William
the Bastard.
</p>

<p>
The people in this district have a curious experiment
to show the wonderful power of the Forest fly
in retaining its grasp.  A man takes the fly between
his finger and thumb, and with the other hand holds
a single hair of a cow or horse for it to seize, then
gently pulls hair and fly apart.  The fly does not
release his hold&mdash;he splits the hair, or at any rate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
shaves a piece off right down to the fine end with
his sharp, grasping claw.  Doubtless the human
parasite will, when his time comes, show an equal
tenacity; he will embrace the biggest and oldest
oak he knows, and to pluck him from his beloved soil
it will be necessary to pull up the tree by its roots.
But this is a detail, and may be left to the engineers.
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Overlooking Beaulieu
</span>
</p>

<p>
Beyond that starved, melancholy wilderness, the
sight of which has led me into so long a digression,
one comes to a point which overlooks the valley of
the Exe; and here one pauses long before going down
to the half-hidden village by the river.  Especially
if it is in May or June, when the oak is in its "glad
light grene," for that is the most vivid and beautiful
of all vegetable greens, and the prospect is the greenest
and most soul-refreshing to be found in England.
The valley is all wooded and the wood is all oak&mdash;a
continuous oak-wood stretching away on the right,
mile on mile, to the sea.  The sensation experienced
at the sight of this prospect is like that of the traveller
in a dry desert when he comes to a clear running
stream and drinks his fill of water and is refreshed.
The river is tidal, and at the full of the tide in its
widest part beside the village its appearance is of a
small inland lake, grown round with oaks&mdash;old trees
that stretch their horizontal branches far out and
wet their lower leaves in the salt water.  The village
itself that has this setting, with its ancient
watermill, its palace of the Montagus, and the Abbey of
Beaulieu, a grey ivied ruin, has a distinction above
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
all Hampshire villages, and is unlike all others in
its austere beauty and atmosphere of old-world
seclusion and quietude.  Above all is that quality
which the mind imparts&mdash;the expression due to
romantic historical associations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Swallow and pike
</span>
</p>

<p>
One very still, warm summer afternoon I stood on
the margin, looking across the sheet of glassy water
at a heron on the farther side, standing knee-deep
in the shallow water patiently watching for a fish,
his grey figure showing distinctly against a
background of bright green sedges.  Between me and the
heron scores of swallows and martins were hawking
for flies, gliding hither and thither a little above
the glassy surface, and occasionally dropping down
to dip and wet their under plumage in the water.
And all at once, fifty yards out from the margin,
there was a great splash, as if a big stone had been
flung out into the lake; and then two or three
moments later out from the falling spray and rocking
water rose a swallow, struggling laboriously up, its
plumage drenched, and flew slowly away.  A big
pike had dashed at and tried to seize it at the moment
of dipping in the water, and the swallow had escaped
as by a miracle.  I turned round to see if any person
was near, who might by chance have witnessed so
strange a thing, in order to speak to him about it.
There was no person within sight, but if on turning
round my eyes had encountered the form of a
Cistercian monk, returning from his day's labour
in the fields, in his dirty black-and-white robe, his
implements on his shoulders, his face and hands
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
begrimed with dust and sweat, the apparition on that
day, in the mood I was in, would not have greatly
surprised me.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere, the expression of the past may
so attune the mind as almost to produce the illusion
that the past is now.
</p>

<p>
But more than old memories, great as their power
over the mind is at certain impressible moments, and
more than Beaulieu as a place where men dwell, is
that ineffable freshness of nature, that verdure that
like the sunlight and the warmth of the sun
penetrates to the inmost being.  Here I have remembered
the old ornithologist Willughby's suggestion, which
no longer seemed fantastic, that the furred and
feathered creatures inhabiting arctic regions have
grown white by force of imagination and the constant
intuition of snow.  And here too I have recalled
that modern fancy that the soul in man has its
proper shape and colour, and have thought that if
I came hither with a grey or blue or orange or brown
soul, its colour had now changed to green.  The
pleasure of it has detained me long days in spring,
often straying by the river at its full, among the
broadly-branching oaks, delighting my sight with
the new leaves
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Love of open spaces
</span>
</p>

<p>
Yet these same oak woods, great as their charm is,
their green everlasting gladness, have a less enduring
hold on the spirit than the open heath, though this
may look melancholy and almost desolate on coming
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
to it from those sunlit emerald glades with a green
thought in the soul.  It seems enough that it is
open, where the wind blows free, and there is nothing
between us and the sun.  It is a passion, an old
ineradicable instinct in us: the strongest impulse
in children, savage or civilised, is to go out into
some open place.  If a man be capable of an exalted
mood, of a sense of absolute freedom, so that he is
no longer flesh and spirit but both in one, and one
with nature, it comes to him like some miraculous
gift on a hill or down or wide open heath.  "You
never enjoy the earth aright," wrote Thomas
Traherne in his <i>Divine Raptures</i>, "until the sun itself
floweth through your veins, till you are clothed with
the heavens and crowned with the stars, and perceive
yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world."
</p>

<p>
It may be observed that we must be out and well
away from the woods and have a wide horizon all
around in order to feel the sun flowing through us.
Many of us have experienced these "divine raptures,"
this sublimated state of feeling; and such moments
are perhaps the best in our earthly lives; but it is
mainly the Trahernes, the Silurist Vaughans, the
Newmans, the Frederic Myers, the Coventry Patmores,
the Wordsworths, that speak of them, since
such moods best fit, or can be made to fit in with
their philosophy, or mysticism, and are, to them, its
best justification.
</p>

<p>
This wide heath, east of Beaulieu, stretching miles
away towards Southampton Water, looks level to
the eye.  But it is not so; it is grooved with long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
valley-like depressions with marshy or boggy bottoms,
all draining into small tributaries of the Dark Water,
which flows into the Solent near Lepe.  In these
bottoms and in all the wet places the heather and
furze mixes with or gives place to the bog myrtle,
or golden withy; and on the spongiest spots the
fragrant yellow stars of the bog asphodel are common
in June.  These spots are exceedingly rich in colour,
with greys and emerald greens and orange yellows
of moss and lichen, flecked with the snow-white
of cotton-grass.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, besides that cause of contentment
which we find in openness, there is fragrance in
fuller measure than in most places.  One may wade
through acres of myrtle, until that subtle delightful
odour is in one's skin and clothes, and in the air
one breathes, and seems at last to penetrate and
saturate the whole being, and smell seems to be for
a time the most important of the senses.
</p>

<p>
Among the interesting birds that breed on the
heath, the nightjar is one of the commonest.  A
keen naturalist, Mr. E. A. Bankes, who lived close
by, told me that he had marked the spot where he
had found a pair of young birds, and that each time
he rode over the heath he had a look at them, and
as they remained there until able to fly, he concluded
that it is not true that the parent birds remove
the young when the nest has been discovered.
</p>

<p>
I was not convinced, as it did not appear that he
had handled the young birds: he had only looked
at them while sitting on his horse.  The following
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
summer I found a pair of young not far from the
same spot: they were half-fledged and very active,
running into the heath and trying to hide from
me, but I caught and handled them for some minutes,
the parent bird remaining near, uttering her cries.
I marked the spot and went back next day, only
to find that the birds had vanished.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Snipe: Redshank
</span>
</p>

<p>
The snipe, too, is an annual breeder, and from
what I saw of it on the heath I think we have yet
something to learn concerning the breeding habits
of that much-observed bird.  The parent bird is not
so wise as most mothers of the feathered world,
since her startling cry of alarm, sounding in a small
way like the snort of a frightened horse, will attract
a person to the spot where she is sheltering her young
among the myrtle.  She will repeat the cry at intervals
a dozen times without stirring or attempting to conceal
the young.  But she does not always act in the same
way.  Sometimes she has risen to a great height and
begun circling above me, the circles growing smaller
or larger as I came nearer or went farther from the
spot where the young were lurking.
</p>

<p>
It was until recently a moot question as to whether
or not the female snipe made the drumming or
bleating sound; some of the authorities say that this
sound proceeds only from the male bird.  I have no
doubt that both birds make the sound.  Invariably
when I disturbed a snipe with young, and when she
mounted high in the air, to wheel round and round,
uttering her anxious cries, she dashed downwards at
intervals, and produced the bleating or drumming
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
which the male birds emit when playing about
the sky.
</p>

<p>
In all cases where I have found young snipe there
was but one old bird, the female, no doubt.  In some
instances I have spent an hour with the young birds
by me, or in my hands, waiting for the other parent
to appear; and I am almost convinced that the care
of the young falls wholly on the female.
</p>

<p>
The redshank, that graceful bird with a beautiful
voice, breeds here most years, and is in a perpetual
state of anxiety so long as a human figure remains
in sight.  A little while ago the small vari-coloured
stonechat or fuzz-jack, with red breast, black head
and white collar, sitting upright and motionless, like
a painted image of a bird, on the topmost spray of
a furze bush, then flitting to perch on another bush,
then to another, for ever emitting those two little
contrasted sounds&mdash;the guttural chat and the clear,
fretful pipe&mdash;had seemed to me the most troubled
and full of care and worries of all Nature's feathered
children&mdash;so sorrowful, in spite of his pretty
harlequin dress!  Now his trouble seems a small thing,
and not to be regarded in the presence of the larger,
louder redshank.  As I walk he rises a long way ahead,
and wheeling about comes towards me&mdash;he and she,
and by-and-by a second pair, and perhaps a third;
they come with measured pulsation of the long,
sharp, white-banded wings; and the first comer
sweeps by and returns again to meet the others,
clamouring all the time, calling on them to join in
the outcry until the whole air seems full of their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
trouble.  To and fro he flies, to this side and that;
and finally, as if in imitation of the small, fretful
stonechat, he sweeps down to alight on the topmost
spray of some small tree or tall bush&mdash;not a furze
but a willow; and as it is an insecure stand for a
bird of his long thin wading legs, he stands lightly,
balancing himself with his wings; beautiful in his
white and pale-grey plumage, and his slender form,
on that airy perch of the willow in its grey-green
leaves and snow-white catkins; and balanced there,
he still continues his sorrowful anxious cries&mdash;ever
crying for me to go&mdash;to go away and leave him in
peace.  I leave him reluctantly, and have my reward,
for no sooner does he see me going than his anxious
cries change to that beautiful wild pipe, unrivalled
except by the curlew among shore birds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Pewit
</span>
</p>

<p>
Worst of all birds that can have no peace in their
lives so long as you are in sight is the pewit.  The
harsh wailing sound of his crying voice as he wheels
about overhead, the mad downward rushes, when his
wings creak as he nears you, give the idea that he
is almost crazed with anxiety; and one feels ashamed
at causing so much misery.  Oh, poor bird! is there
no way to make you understand without leaving
the ground, that your black-spotted, olive-coloured
eggs are perfectly safe; that a man can walk about
on the heath and be no more harmful to you than
the Forest ponies, and the ragged donkey browsing
on a furze bush, and the cow with her tinkling bell?
I stand motionless, looking the other way; I sit
down to think; I lie flat on my back with hands
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
clasped behind my head, and gaze at the sky, and
still the trouble goes on&mdash;he will not believe in me,
nor tolerate me.  There is nothing to do but get up
and go away out of sight and sound of the pewits.
</p>

<p>
It appears to me that this sympathy for the lower
animals is very much a matter of association&mdash;an
overflow of that regard for the rights of and
compassion for others of our kind which are at the
foundations of the social instinct.  The bird is a
red- and a warm-blooded being&mdash;we have seen that
its blood is red, and when we take a living bird
in our hands we feel its warmth and the throbbing
of its breast: therefore birds are related to us, and
with that red human blood they have human
passions.  Witness the pewit&mdash;the mother bird, when
you have discovered or have come near her downy
little one&mdash;could any human mother, torn with the
fear of losing her babe, show her unquiet and
disturbed state in a plainer, more understandable way!
But in the case of creatures of another division in
the kingdom of life&mdash;non-vertebrates, without sensible
heat, and with a thin colourless fluid instead of red
blood, as if like plants they had only a vegetative
life&mdash;this sympathy is not felt as a rule.  When, in
some exceptional case, the feeling is there, it is
because some human association has come into the
mind in spite of the differences between insect
and man.
</p>

<p>
Walking on this heath I saw a common green
grasshopper, disturbed at my step, leap away, and
by chance land in a geometric web in a small furze
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
bush.  Caught in the web, it began kicking with its
long hind legs, and would in three seconds have made
its escape.  But mark what happened.  Directly
over the web, and above the kicking grasshopper,
there was a small, web-made, thimble-shaped shelter,
mouth down, fastened to a spray, and the spider was
sitting in it.  And looking down it must have seen
and known that the grasshopper was far too big and
strong to be held in that frailest snare, that it would
be gone in a moment and the net torn to pieces.  It
also must have seen and known that it was no wasp
nor dangerous insect of any kind; and so, instantly,
straight and swift as a leaden plummet, it dropped
out of the silvery bell it lived in on to the grasshopper
and attacked it at the head.  The falces were probably
thrust into the body between the head and pro-thorax,
for almost instantly the struggle ceased, and
in less than three seconds the victim appeared
perfectly dead.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Grasshopper and spider
</span>
</p>

<p>
What interested me in this sight was the spider,
an <i>Epeira</i> of a species I had never closely looked at
before, a little less in size than our famous <i>Epeira
diadema</i>&mdash;our common garden spider, with the pretty
white diadem on its velvety, brown abdomen.  This
heath spider was creamy-white in colour, the white
deepening to warm buff all round at the sides, and
to a deeper tint on the under surface.  It was curiously
and prettily coloured; and, being new to me, its
image was vividly impressed on my mind.
</p>

<p>
As to what had happened, that did not impress
me at all.  I could not, like the late noble poet who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
cherished an extreme animosity against the spider,
and inveighed against it in brilliant, inspired verse,
remember and brood sadly on the thought of the
fairy forms that are its victims&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The lovely births that winnow by,<br />
  Twin-sisters of the rainbow sky:<br />
  Elf-darlings, fluffy, bee-bright things,<br />
  And owl-white moths with mealy wings.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Nor could I, like him, break the creature's toils, nor
take the dead from its gibbet, nor slay it on account
of its desperate wickedness.  These are mere
house-bred feelings and fancies, perhaps morbid; he who
walks out of doors with Nature, who sees life and
death as sunlight and shadow, on witnessing such
an incident wishes the captor a good appetite, and,
passing on, thinks no more about it.  For any day in
summer, sitting by the water, or in a wood, or on
the open heath, I note little incidents of this kind;
they are always going on in thousands all about us,
and one with trained eye cannot but see them; but
no feeling is excited, no sympathy, and they are no
sooner seen than forgotten.  But, as I said, there
are exceptional cases, and here is one which refers
to an even more insignificant creature than a field
grasshopper&mdash;a small dipterous insect&mdash;and yet I was
strangely moved by it.
</p>

<p>
The insect was flying rather slowly by me over
the heath&mdash;a thin, yellow-bodied, long-legged
creature, a <i>Tipula</i>, about half as big as our familiar
crane-fly.  Now, as it flew by me about on a level
with my thighs, up from the heath at my feet shot
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
out a second insect, about the same size as the first,
also a Dipteron, but of another family&mdash;one of the
Asilidæ, which are rapacious.  The <i>Asilus</i> was also
very long-legged, and seizing the other with its legs,
the two fell together to the ground.  Stooping down,
I witnessed the struggle.  They were locked together,
and I saw the attacking insect raise his head and the
forepart of his body so as to strike, then plunge his
rostrum like a dagger in the soft part of his victim's
body.  Again and again he raised and buried his
weapon in the other, and the other still refused to
die or to cease struggling.  And this little fight and
struggle of two flies curiously moved me, and for
some time I could not get over the feeling of intense
repugnance it excited.  This feeling was wholly due
to association: the dagger-like weapon and the
action of the insect were curiously human-like, and
I had seen just such a combat between two men,
one fallen and the other on him, raising and striking
down with his knife.  Had I never witnessed such
an incident, the two flies struggling, one killing
the other, would have produced no such feeling,
and would not have been remembered.

We live in thoughts and feelings, not in days

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="poem">
as some poet has said, and, recalling an afternoon
and an evening spent on this heath, it does not seem
to my mind like an evening passed alone in a vacant
place, in the usual way, watching and listening and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
thinking of nothing, but an eventful period, which
deeply moved me, and left an enduring memory.
</p>

<p>
The sun went down, and though the distressed
birds had cried till they were weary of crying, I did
not go away.  Something on this occasion kept me,
in spite of the gathering gloom and a cold
wind&mdash;bitterly cold for June&mdash;which blew over the wide
heath.  Here and there the rays from the setting
sun fell upon and lit up the few mounds that rise
like little islands out of the desolate brown waste.
These are the Pixie mounds, the barrows raised by
probably prehistoric men, a people inconceivably
remote in time and spirit from us, whose memory
is pale in our civilised days.

<span class="sidenote">
"World-strangeness"
</span>
</p>

<p>
There are times and moods in which it is revealed
to us, or to a few amongst us, that we are a survival
of the past, a dying remnant of a vanished people,
and are like strangers and captives among those who
do not understand us, and have no wish to do so;
whose language and customs and thoughts are not
ours.  That "world-strangeness," which William
Watson and his fellow-poets prattle in rhyme about,
those, at all events, who have what they call the
"note of modernity" in their pipings, is not in me
as in them.  The blue sky, the brown soil beneath,
the grass, the trees, the animals, the wind, and rain,
and sun, and stars are never strange to me; for I
am in and of and am one with them; and my flesh
and the soil are one, and the heat in my blood and
in the sunshine are one, and the winds and tempests
and my passions are one.  I feel the "strangeness"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
only with regard to my fellow-men, especially in
towns, where they exist in conditions unnatural to
me, but congenial to them; where they are seen in
numbers and in crowds, in streets and houses, and
in all places where they gather together; when I
look at them, their pale civilised faces, their clothes,
and hear them eagerly talking about things that do
not concern me.  They are out of my world&mdash;the real
world.  All that they value, and seek and strain
after all their lives long, their works and sports
and pleasures, are the merest baubles and childish
things; and their ideals are all false, and nothing
but by-products, or growths, of the artificial
life&mdash;little funguses cultivated in heated cellars.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The barrow on the heath
</span>
</p>

<p>
In such moments we sometimes feel a kinship with,
and are strangely drawn to, the dead, who were not
as these; the long, long dead, the men who knew
not life in towns, and felt no strangeness in sun and
wind and rain.  In such a mood on that evening I
went to one of those lonely barrows; one that rises
to a height of nine or ten feet above the level heath,
and is about fifty yards round.  It is a garden in the
brown desert, covered over with a dense growth of
furze bushes, still in flower, mixed with bramble and
elder and thorn, and heather in great clumps, blooming,
too, a month before its time, the fiery purple-red
of its massed blossoms, and of a few tall, tapering
spikes of foxglove, shining against the vivid green
of the young bracken.
</p>

<p>
All this rich wild vegetation on that lonely mound
on the brown heath!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
</p>

<p>
Here, sheltered by the bushes, I sat and saw the
sun go down, and the long twilight deepen till the
oak woods of Beaulieu in the west looked black on
the horizon, and the stars came out: in spite of the
cold wind that made me shiver in my thin clothes, I
sat there for hours, held by the silence and solitariness
of that mound of the ancient dead.
</p>

<p>
Sitting there, profoundly sad for no apparent cause,
with no conscious thought in my mind, it suddenly
occurred to me that I knew that spot from of old,
that in long-past forgotten years I had often come
there of an evening and sat through the twilight,
in love with the loneliness and peace, wishing that
it might be my last resting-place.  To sleep there
for ever&mdash;the sleep that knows no waking!  We say
it, but do not mean&mdash;do not believe it.  Dreams do
come to give us pause; and we know that we have
lived.  To dwell alone, then, with this memory of
life in such a spot for all time!  There are moments
in which the thought of death steals upon and takes
us as it were by surprise, and it is then exceeding
bitter.  It was as if that cold wind blowing over and
making strange whispers in the heather had brought
a sudden tempest of icy rain to wet and chill me.
</p>

<p>
This miserable sensation soon passed away, and,
with quieted heart, I began to grow more and more
attracted by the thought of resting on so blessed a
spot.  To have always about me that wildness which
I best loved&mdash;the rude incult heath, the beautiful
desolation; to have harsh furze and ling and bramble
and bracken to grow on me, and only wild creatures
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
for visitors and company.  The little stonechat, the
tinkling meadow-pipit, the excited whitethroat to
sing to me in summer; the deep-burrowing rabbit
to bring down his warmth and familiar smell among
my bones; the heat-loving adder, rich in colour,
to find when summer is gone a dry safe shelter and
hibernaculum in my empty skull.
</p>

<p>
So beautiful did the thought appear that I could
have laid down my life at that moment, in spite of
death's bitterness, if by so doing I could have had
my desire.  But no such sweet and desirable a thing
could be given me by this strange people and race
that possess the earth, who are not like the people
here with me in the twilight on the heath.  For I
thought, too, of those I should lie with, having with
them my after life; and thinking of them I was no
longer alone.  I thought of them not as others think,
those others of a strange race.  What <i>do</i> they think?
They think so many things!  The materialist, the
scientist, would say: They have no existence; they
ceased to be anything when their flesh was turned
to dust, or burned to ashes, and their minds, or
souls, were changed to some other form of energy,
or motion, or affection of matter, or whatever they
call it.  The believer would not say of them, or of the
immaterial part of them, that they had gone into a
world of light, that in a dream or vision he had seen
them walking in an air of glory; but he might hold
that they had been preached to in Hades some
nineteen centuries ago, and had perhaps repented of
their barbarous deeds.  Or he might think, since he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
has considerable latitude allowed him on the point,
that the imperishable parts of them are here at
this very spot, tangled in dust that was once flesh
and bones, sleeping like chrysalids through a long
winter, to be raised again at the sound of a trumpet
blown by an angel to a second conscious life, happy
or miserable as may be willed.
</p>

<p>
I imagine none of these things, for they were with
me in the twilight on the barrow in crowds, sitting
and standing in groups, and many lying on their
sides on the turf below, their heads resting in their
hands.  They, too, all had their faces turned towards
Beaulieu.  Evening by evening for many and many
a century they had looked to that point, towards
the black wood on the horizon, where there were
people and sounds of human life.  Day by day for
centuries they had listened with wonder and fear to
the Abbey bells, and to the distant chanting of the
monks.  And the Abbey has been in ruins for
centuries, open to the sky and overgrown with ivy; but
still towards that point they look with apprehension,
since men still dwell there, strangers to them, the
little busy eager people, hateful in their artificial
indoor lives, who do not know and who care nothing
for them, who worship not and fear not the dead
that are underground, but dig up their sacred places
and scatter their bones and ashes, and despise and
mock them because they are dead and powerless.
</p>

<p>
It is not strange that they fear and hate.  I look
at them&mdash;their dark, pale, furious faces&mdash;and think
that if they could be visible thus in the daylight, all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
who came to that spot or passed near it would turn
and fly with a terrifying image in their mind which
would last to the end of life.  But they do not resent
my presence, and would not resent it were I permitted
to come at last to dwell with them for ever.  Perhaps
they know me for one of their tribe&mdash;know that
what they feel I feel, would hate what they hate.
</p>

<p>
Has it not been said that love itself is an argument
in favour of immortality?  All love&mdash;the love of men
and women, of a mother for her child, of a friend
for a friend&mdash;the love that will cause him to lay
down his life for another.  Is it possible to believe,
they say, that this beautiful sacred flame can be
darkened for ever when soul and body fall asunder?
But love without hate I do not know and cannot
conceive; one implies the other.  No good and no
bad quality or principle can exist (for me) without
its opposite.  As old Langland wisely says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For by luthere men know the good;<br />
  And whereby wiste men which were white<br />
  If all things black were?<br />

<p>
Looking away from Beaulieu towards Southampton
Water there is seen on the border of
the wide brown heath a long line of tall firs,
a vast dark grove forming the horizon on that side.
This is the edge of an immense wood, and beyond the
pines which grow by the heath, it is almost
exclusively oak with an undergrowth of holly.  It is
low-lying ground with many streams and a good deal of
bog, and owing to the dense undergrowth and the
luxuriance of vegetation generally this part of the
forest has a ruder, wilder appearance than at any
other spot.  Here, too, albeit the nobler bird and
animal forms are absent, as is indeed the case in
all the New Forest district, animal life generally is in
greatest profusion and variety.  This wood with its
surrounding heaths, bogs, and farm lands, has been
my favourite summer resort and hunting-ground for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
some years past.  With a farm-house not many
minutes' walk from the forest for a home, I have here
spent long weeks at a time, rambling in the woods
every day and all day long, for the most time out
of sight of human habitations, and always with the
feeling that I was in my own territory, where
everything was as Nature made it and as I liked it to be.
Never once in all my rambles did I encounter that
hated being, the collector, with his white, spectacled
town face and green butterfly net.  In this out-of-the-way
corner of the Forest one could imagine the
time come when this one small piece of England
which lies between the Avon and Southampton
Water will be a sanctuary for all rare and beautiful
wild life and a place of refreshment to body and soul
for all men.
</p>

<p>
The richest, fullest time of the year is when June
is wearing to an end, when one knows without the
almanac that spring is over and gone.  Nowhere in
England is one more sensible of the change to
fullest summer than in this low-lying, warmest
corner of Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
The cuckoo ceases to weary us with its incessant
call, and the nightingale sings less and less frequently.
The passionate season is well-nigh over for birds;
their fountain of music begins to run dry.  The
cornfields and waste grounds are everywhere splashed
with the intense scarlet of poppies.  Summer has no
rain in all her wide, hot heavens to give to her
thirsty fields, and has sprinkled them with the red
fiery moisture from her own veins.  And as colour
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
changes, growing deeper and more intense, so do
sounds change: for the songs of yesterday there are
shrill hunger-cries.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Young blackbird's call
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the oftenest heard in all the open woods,
in hedges, and even out in the cornfields is the
curious musical call of the young blackbird.  It is
like the chuckle of the adult, but not so loud, full,
happy, and prolonged; it is shriller, and drops at the
end to a plaintive, impatient sound, a little
pathetic&mdash;a cry of the young bird to its too long absent
mother.  When very hungry he emits this shrill
musical call at intervals of ten to fifteen seconds;
it may be heard distinctly a couple of hundred
yards away.
</p>

<p>
The numbers of young blackbirds and throstles
apparently just out of the nest astonish one.  They
are not only in the copses and hedges, and on almost
every roadside tree, but you constantly see them
on the ground in the lanes and public roads, standing
still, quite unconscious of danger.  The poor helpless
bird looks up at you in a sort of amazement, never
having seen men walking or riding on bicycles; but
he hesitates, not knowing whether to fly away or
stand still.  Thrush or blackbird, he is curiously
interesting to look at.  The young thrush, with his
yellowish-white spotty breast, the remains of down
on his plumage, his wide yellow mouth, and raised
head with large, fixed, toad-like eyes, has a distinctly
reptilian appearance.  Not so the young blackbird,
standing motionless on the road, in doubt too as
to what you are; his short tail raised, giving him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
an incipient air of blackbird jauntiness; his plumage
not brown, indeed, as we describe it, but rich
chestnut-black, like the chestnut-black hair of a beautiful
Hampshire girl of that precious type with oval face
and pale dark skin.  A pretty creature, rich in colour,
with a musical, pathetic voice, waiting so patiently
to be visited and fed, and a weasel perhaps watching
him from the roadside grass with hungry, bright
little eyes!  How they die&mdash;thrushes and blackbirds&mdash;at
this perilous period in their lives!  I sometimes
see what looks like a rudely painted figure of a bird
on the hard road: it is a young blackbird that had
not the sense to get out of the way of a passing team,
and was crushed flat by a hoof or wheel.  It is but one
in a thousand that perishes in that way.  One has to
remember that these two species of thrush&mdash;throstle
and blackbird&mdash;are in extraordinary abundance, that
next to starlings and chaffinches they abound over
all species; that they are exceedingly prolific, beginning
to lay in this southern country in February, and
rearing at least three broods in the season; and that
when winter comes round again the thrush and
blackbird population will be just about what it
was before.
</p>

<p>
Fruit-eating birds do not much vex the farmer in
this almost fruitless country.  Thrushes and finches
and sparrows are nothing to him: the starling, if
he pays any attention to the birds, he looks on as
a good friend.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Starlings breeding
</span>
</p>

<p>
At the farm there are two very old yew trees
growing in the back-yard, and one of these, in an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
advanced state of decay, is full of holes and cavities
in its larger branches.  Here about half a dozen pairs
of starlings nest every year, and by the middle of
June there are several broods of fully-fledged young.
At this time it was amusing to watch the parent
birds at their task, coming and going all day long,
flying out and away straight as arrows to this side
and that, every bird to its own favourite
hunting-ground.  Some had their grounds in the meadow,
just before the house where the cows and geese were,
and it was easy to watch their movements.  Out of
the yew the bird would shoot, and in ten or twelve
seconds would be down walking about in that busy,
plodding, rook-like way the starling has when
looking for something; and presently, darting his beak
into the turf, he would drag out something large,
and back he would fly to his young with a big,
conspicuous, white object in his beak.  These white
objects which he was busily gathering every day,
from dawn to dark, were full-grown grubs of the
cockchafer.  When watching these birds at their
work it struck me that the enormous increase of
starlings all over the country in recent years may
account for the fact that great cockchafer years do
not now occur.  In former years these beetles were
sometimes in such numbers that they swarmed in
the air in places, and stripped the oaks of their leaves
in midsummer.  It is now more than ten years since
I saw cockchafers in considerable numbers, and for a
long time past I have not heard of their appearance
in swarms anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p>
The starling is in some ways a bad bird, a cherry
thief, and a robber of other birds' nesting-places;
yaffle and nuthatch must hate him, but if his ministrations
have caused an increase of even one per cent. in
the hay crop, and the milk and butter supply, he
is, from our point of view, not wholly bad.
</p>

<p>
In late June the unkept hedges are in the fullness
of their midsummer beauty.  After sunset the
fragrance of the honeysuckle is almost too much:
standing near the blossom-laden hedge when there is no
wind to dissipate the odour, there is a heaviness in
it which makes it like some delicious honeyed liquor
which we are drinking in.  The honeysuckle is indeed
first among the "melancholy flowers" that give out
their fragrance by night.  In the daytime, when the
smell is faint, the pale sickly blossoms are hardly
noticed even where they are seen in masses and
drape the hedges.  Of all the hedge-flowers, the rose
alone is looked at, its glory being so great as to make
all other blooms seem nothing but bleached or dead
discoloured leaves in comparison.
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
Beauty of the hedge rose
</span>
</p>

<p>
He would indeed be a vainly ambitious person who
should attempt to describe this queen of all wild
flowers, joyous or melancholy; but substituting
flower for fruit, and the delight of the eye for the
pleasure of taste, we may in speaking of it quote
the words of a famous old writer, used in praise of
the strawberry.  He said that doubtless God Almighty
could have made a better berry if He had been so
minded, but doubtless God Almighty never did.
</p>

<p>
I esteem the rose not only for that beauty which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
sets it highest among flowers, but also because it
will not suffer admiration when removed from its
natural surroundings.  In this particular it resembles
certain brilliant sentient beings that languish and
lose all their charms in captivity.  Pluck your rose
and bring it indoors, and place it side by side with
other blossoms&mdash;yellow flag and blue periwinkle, and
shining yellow marsh-marigold, and poppy and
cornflower&mdash;and it has no lustre, and is no more to the
soul than a flower made out of wax or paper.  Look
at it here, in the brilliant sunlight and the hot wind,
waving to the wind on its long thorny sprays all over
the vast disordered hedges; here in rosy masses, there
starring the rough green tangle with its rosy stars&mdash;a
rose-coloured cloud on the earth and Summer's
bridal veil&mdash;and you will refuse to believe (since it
will be beyond your power to imagine) that anywhere
on the earth, in any hot or temperate climate, there
exists a more divinely beautiful sight.
</p>

<p>
If among the numberless cults that flourish in the
earth we could count a cult of the rose, to this spot
the votaries of the flower might well come each
midsummer to hold their festival.  They would be
youthful and beautiful, their lips red, their eyes full
of laughter; and they would be arrayed in light
silken garments of delicate colour&mdash;green, rose, and
white; and their arms and necks and foreheads
would shine with ornaments of gold and precious
stones.  In their hands would be musical instruments
of many pretty shapes with which they would sweetly
accompany their clear voices as they sat or stood
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
beneath the old oak trees, and danced in sun and
shade, and when they moved in bright procession
along the wide grass-grown roads, through forest
and farm-land.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lesser whitethroat
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1900 I found the lesser
whitethroat&mdash;the better whitethroat I should prefer to
call it&mdash;in extraordinary abundance in the large
unkept hedges east of the woods in the parishes of
Fawley and Exbury.  Hitherto I had always found
this species everywhere thinly distributed; here it was
abundant as the reed-warblers along the dykes in the
flat grass-lands on the Somerset coast, and like the
reed-warblers in the reed- and sedge-grown ditches
and streams, each pair of whitethroats had its own
part of the hedge; so that in walking in a lane when
you left one singing behind you heard his next neighbour
singing at a distance of fifteen or twenty yards
farther on, and from end to end of the great hedge
you had that continuous beautiful low warble at
your side, and sometimes on both sides.  The loud
brief song of this whitethroat, which resembles the
first part of a chaffinch's song, is a pleasant sound
and nothing more; the low warbling, which runs on
without a break for forty or fifty seconds, or longer,
is the beautiful song, and resembles the low
continuous warble of the blackcap, but is more varied,
and has one sound which is unique in the songs of
British birds.  This is a note repeated two or three
times at intervals in the course of the song, of an
excessive sharpness, unlike any other bird sound,
but comparable to the silvery shrilling of the great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
green grasshopper&mdash;excessively sharp, yet musical.
The bird emits this same silver shrill note when
angry and when fighting, but it is then louder and
not so musical, and resembles the sharpest sounds
made by bats and other small mammals when excited.
</p>

<p>
One day I sat down near a hedge, where an old
half-dead oak stood among the thorns and brambles,
and just by the oak a lesser whitethroat was moving
about and singing.  Out among the furze bushes at
some distance from the hedge a common whitethroat
was singing, flitting and darting from bush
to bush, rising at intervals into the air and dropping
again into the furze; but by-and-by he rose to a
greater height to pour out his mad confused strain
in the air, then sloped away to the hedge and settled,
still singing, on the dead branch of the oak.  Up
rose the lesser whitethroat and attacked it with
extreme fury, rising to a height of two or three feet
and dashing repeatedly at it, looking like a miniature
kestrel or hobby; and every time it descended the
other ducked his head and flattened himself on the
branch, only to rise again, crest erect and throat
puffed out, still pouring forth its defiant song.  As long
as this lasted the attacking bird emitted his piercing
metallic anger-note, rapidly and continuously, like
the clicking of steel machinery.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I fear I shall not again see the lesser
whitethroat as I saw him in that favoured year: in 1901
he came not, or came in small numbers; and it was
the same in the spring of 1902.  The spring was
cold and backward in both years, and the bitter
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
continuous east winds which prevailed in March and
April probably proved fatal to large numbers of the
more delicate migrants.
</p>

<p>
In this low, level country, sheltered by woods and
hedgerows, we feel the tremendous power of the sun
even before the last week in June.  It is good to
feel, to bathe in the heat all day long; but at noon
one sometimes finds it too hot even on the open
heath, and is forced to take shelter in the woods.
It was always coolest on the high ground among
the pines, where the trees are very tall and there is
no underwood.  In spring it was always pleasant to
walk here on the thick carpet of fallen needles and
old dead fern; now, in a very short time, the young
bracken has sprung up as if by miracle to a nearly
uniform height of about four feet.  It spreads all
around me for many acres&mdash;an unbroken sea of
brilliant green, out of which rise the tall red columns
of the pines supporting the dark woodland roof.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A sheet of bracken
</span>
</p>

<p>
Why is it, when in June the luxuriant young
bracken first drops its fully developed fronds, so that
frond touches frond, many overlapping, forming a
billowy expanse of vivid green, hiding, or all but
hiding, the brown or red soil beneath&mdash;why is it the
eyes rest with singular satisfaction on it?  It is not
only because of the colour, nor the beauty of contrast
where the red floor of last year's beech leaves is seen
through the fresh verdure, and of dark red-boled
pines rising from the green sea of airy fronds.  Colours
and contrasts more beautiful may be seen, and the
pleasure they give is different in kind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
</p>

<p>
Here standing amid the fern, where it had at last
formed that waving surface and was a little above my
knees, it seemed to me that the particular satisfaction
I experienced was due to the fine symmetrical leafing
of the surface, the minute subdivision of parts which
produced an effect similar to that of a mosaic floor.
When I consider other surfaces, on land or water,
I find the same gratification in all cases where it is
broken or marked out or fretted in minute, more
or less orderly subdivisions.  The glass-like or oily
surface of water, where there are no reflections to
bring other feelings in, does not hold or attract but
rather wearies the sight; but it is no sooner touched
to a thousand minute crinkles by the wind, than it
is looked at with refreshment and pleasure.  The bed
of a clear stream, with its pavement of minute
variegated pebbles and spots of light and shade,
pleases in the same way.  The sight rests with some
satisfaction even on a stagnant pond covered with
green duckweed; but the satisfaction is less in this
case on account of the extreme minuteness of the
parts and the too great smoothness.  The roads and
open spaces in woods in October and November are
delightful to walk in when they are like richly
variegated floors composed of small pieces, and like dark
floors inlaid with red and gold of beech and oak
leaves.  Numberless instances might be given, and we
see that the effect is produced even in small objects,
as, for instance, in scaly fishes and in serpents.
It is the minutely segmented texture of the serpent
which, with the colour, gives it its wonderful richness.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
For the same reason a crocodile bag is more admired
than one of cowhide, and a book in buckram looks
better than one in cloth or even vellum.
</p>

<p>
The old Romans must have felt this instinctive
pleasure of the eye very keenly when they took such
great pains over their floors.  I was strongly
impressed with this fact at Silchester when looking at
the old floors of rich and poor houses alike which
have been uncovered during the last two or three
years.  They seem to have sought for the effect of
mosaic even in the meaner habitations, and in passages
and walks, and when tesseræ could not be had they
broke up common tiles into small square fragments,
and made their floors in that way.  Even with so
poor a material, and without any ornamentation,
they did get the effect sought, and those ancient
fragments of floors made of fragments of tiles,
unburied after so many centuries, do actually more
gratify the sight than the floors of polished oak or
other expensive material which are seen in our
mansions and palaces.
</p>

<p>
There is doubtless a physiological reason for this
satisfaction to the eye, as indeed there is for so many
of the pleasurable sensations we experience in seeing.
We may say that the vision flies over a perfectly
smooth plain surface, like a ball over a sheet of ice,
and rests nowhere; but that in a mosaic floor the
segmentation of the surface stays and rests the sight.
To go no farther than that, which is but a part of the
secret, the sheet of fern fronds, on account of this
staying effect on the vision, increases what we see,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
so that a surface of a dozen square yards of fern
seems more in extent than half an acre of
smooth-shaven lawn, or the large featureless floor of a
skating-rink or ball-room.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Harshening bird-voices
</span>
</p>

<p>
On going or wading through the belt of bracken
under the tall firs&mdash;that billowy sea of fronds in the
midst of which I have so long detained my patient
reader&mdash;into the great oak wood beyond and below
it, on each successive visit during the last days of
June, the harshening of the bird voices became more
marked.  Only the wren and wood-wren and willow-wren
uttered an occasional song, but the bigger birds
made most of the sound.  Families of young jays were
then just out of the nest, crying with hunger, and
filling the wood with their discordant screams when
the parent birds came with food.  A pair of kestrels,
too, with a nestful of young on a tall fir incessantly
uttered their shrill reiterated cries when I was near;
and one pair of green woodpeckers, with young out
of the breeding-hole but not yet able to fly, were
half crazed with anxiety.  Around me and on before
me they flitted from tree to tree and clung to the bark,
wings spread out and crest raised, their loud laugh
changed to a piercing cry of anger that pained the sense.
</p>

<p>
They were now moved only by solicitude and anger:
all other passion and music had gone out of the bird
and into the insect world.  The oak woods were now
full of a loud continuous hum like that of a distant
threshing-machine; an unbroken deep sound composed
of ten thousand thousand small individual
sounds conjoined in one, but diffused and flowing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
like water over the surface, under the trees, and the
rough bushy tangle.  The incredible number and
variety of blood-sucking flies makes this same low
hot part of the Forest as nearly like a transcript of
tropical nature in some damp, wooded district as
may be found in England.  But these Forest flies,
even when they came in legions about me, were not
able to spoil my pleasure.  It was delightful to see
so much life&mdash;to visit and sit down with them in
their own domestic circle.
</p>

<p>
In other days, in a distant region, I have passed
many a night out of doors in the presence of a cloud
of mosquitoes; and when during restless sleep I have
pulled the covering from my face, they had me at
their mercy.  For the smarts they inflicted on me
then I have my reward, since the venom they
injected into my veins has proved a lasting
prophylactic.  But to the poor cattle this place must be a
very purgatory, a mazy wilderness swarming with
minute hellish imps that mock their horns and giant
strength, and cannot be shaken off.  While sitting
on the roots of a tree in the heart of the wood, I
heard the heavy tramping and distressed bellowings of
several beasts coming at a furious rate towards me,
and presently half a dozen heifers and young bulls
burst through the bushes; and catching sight of me
at a distance of ten or twelve yards, they suddenly
came to a dead stop, glaring at me with strange,
mad, tortured eyes; then swerving aside, crashed
away through the undergrowth in another direction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dark Water
</span>
</p>

<p>
In this wood I sought and found the stream well
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
named the Dark Water; here, at all events, it is
grown over with old ivied oaks, with brambles and
briars that throw long branches from side to side,
making the almost hidden current in the deep shade
look black; but when the sunlight falls on it the
water is the colour of old sherry from the red soil
it flows over.  No sooner had I sat down on the
bank, where I had a little space of sunlit water to
look upon, than the flies gathered thick about and
on me, and I began to pay some attention to
individuals among them.  Those that came to suck blood,
and settled at once in a business-like manner on my
legs, were some hairy and some smooth, and of
various colours&mdash;grey, black, steel-blue, and barred
and ringed with bright tints; and with these
distinguished guests came numberless others, small lean
gnats mostly, without colour, and of no consideration.
I did not so much mind these as the others that
simply buzzed round without an object&mdash;flies that
have no beauty, no lancet to stab you with, and no
distinction of any kind, yet will persist in forcing
themselves on your attention.  They buzz and buzz,
and are loudest in your ear when you are most
anxious to listen to some distant faint sound.  If a
blood-sucker hurts you, you can slap him to death,
and there's an end of the matter; but slap at one
of these idle, aimless, teasing flies as hard as you
like, and he is gone like quicksilver through your
fingers.  He is buzzing derisively in your ears: "Slap
away as much as you like&mdash;it pleases you and doesn't
hurt me."  And then down again in the same place!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
</p>

<p>
When the others&mdash;the serious flies on business
bent&mdash;got too numerous, I began to slap my legs,
killing one or two of the greediest at each slap, and
to throw their small corpses on the sunlit current.
These slain flies were not wasted, for very soon
I had quite a number of little minnows close to my
feet, eager to seize them as they fell.  And, by-and-by,
three fiddlers, or pond-skaters, "sagacious of their
quarry from afar," came skating into sight on the
space of bright water; and to these mysterious,
uncanny-looking creatures&mdash;insect ghosts that walk
on the water, but with very unghost-like appetites&mdash;I
began tossing some of the flies; and each time
a fiddler seized a floating fly he skated away into
the shade with it to devour it in peace and quiet
all alone by himself.  For a fiddler with a fly is like
a dog with a bone among other hungry dogs.  When
I had finished feeding my ghosts and little fishes,
I got up and left the place, for the sun was travelling
west and the greatest heat was over.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The stag-beetle
</span>
</p>

<p>
During the last week in June we can look
for the appearance of our most majestical
insect; he is an evening flyer, and a little
before sunset begins to show himself abroad.  He
is indeed a monarch among hexapods, with none
to equal him save, perhaps, the great goblin moth;
and in shape and size and solidity he bears about
the same relation to pretty bright flies as a horned
rhinoceros does to volatile squirrels and monkeys
and small barred and spotted felines.  This is the
stag-beetle&mdash;"stags and does" is the native name
for the two sexes; he is probably more abundant
in this corner of Hampshire than in any other
locality in England, and among the denizens of
the Forest there are few more interesting.  About
four or five o'clock in the afternoon, the ponderous
beetle wakes out of his long siesta, down among the
roots and dead vegetable matter of a thorny brake
or large hedge, and laboriously sets himself to work
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
his way out.  He is a slow, clumsy creature, a very
bad climber; and small wonder, when we consider
how he is impeded by his long branched horns when
endeavouring to make his way upwards through a
network of interlacing stems.
</p>

<p>
As you walk by the hedge-side a strange noise
suddenly arrests your attention; it is the buzz of an
insect, but loud enough to startle you; it might be
mistaken for the reeling of a nightjar, but is perhaps
more like the jarring hum of a fast-driven motor-car.
The reason of the noise is that the beetle has
with great pains climbed up a certain height from
the ground, and, in order to ascertain whether he
has got far enough, he erects himself on his stand,
lifts his wing-cases, shakes out his wings, and begins
to agitate them violently, turning this way and that
to make sure that he has a clear space.  If he then
attempts to fly&mdash;it is one of his common blunders&mdash;he
instantly strikes against some branch or cluster
of leaves, and is thrown down.  The tumble does not
hurt him in the least, but so greatly astonishes him
that he remains motionless a good while; then
recovering his senses, he begins to ascend again.  At
length, after a good many accidents and adventures
by the way, he gets to a topmost twig, and, after
some buzzing to get up steam, launches himself
heavily on the air and goes away in grand style.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Miller, in his autobiography, tells of the
discovery he made of a curiously striking resemblance
in shape between our most elegantly made carriages
and the bodies of wasps, the resemblance being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
heightened by a similarity of colouring seen in the
lines and bands of vivid yellows and reds on a polished
black ground.  This likeness between insect and
carriage does not appear so striking at this day owing
to a change in the fashion towards a more sombre
colour in the vehicles; their funeral blacks, dark
blues, and greens being now seldom relieved with
bright yellows and reds.  The stag-beetle, too, when
he goes away with heavy flight always gives one the
idea of some kind of machine or vehicle, not like the
aerial phaeton of the wasp or hornet, with its graceful
lines and strongly-contrasted colours, but an oblong,
ponderous, armour-plated car, furnished with a beak,
and painted a deep uniform brown.
</p>

<p>
Birds, especially the more aerial insectivorous
kinds, have the habit of flying at and teasing any
odd or grotesque-looking creature they may see on
the wing&mdash;as a bat, for instance.  I have seen small
birds dart at a passing stag, but on coming near
they turn tail and fly from him, frightened perhaps
at his formidable appearance and loud noise.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding his lumbering, blundering ways,
when the stag is abroad in search of the doe, you
may see that he is endowed with a sense and faculty
so exquisite as to make it appear almost miraculous
in the sureness of its action.  The void air, as he
sweeps droning through it, is peopled with subtle
intelligences, which elude and mock and fly from
him, and which he pursues until he finds out their
secret.  They mock him most, or, to drop the metaphor,
he is most at fault, on a still sultry day when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
not a breath of air is stirring.  At times he catches
what, for want of better knowledge, we must call
a scent, and in order to fix the direction it comes
from he goes through a series of curious movements.
You will see him rise above a thorny thicket, or
a point where two hedges intersect at right angles,
and remain suspended on his wings a few inches
above the hedge-top for one or two minutes, loudly
humming, and turning by a succession of jerks all
round, pausing after each turn, until he has faced
all points of the compass.
</p>

<p>
This failing, he darts away and circles widely
round, then returning to the central point suspends
himself as before.  After spending several minutes
in this manner, he once more resumes his wanderings.
Several males are sometimes attracted to the same
spot, but they pass and repass without noticing one
another.  You will see as many as three or four or
half a dozen majestically moving up and down at
a hedge-side or in a narrow path in a hazel copse,
each beetle turning when he gets to the end and
marching back again; and altogether their measured,
stately, and noisy movements are a fine spectacle.
</p>

<p>
A slight wind makes a great difference to him:
even a current of air so faint as not to be felt on the
face will reveal to him the exact distant spot in which
the doe is lurking.  The following incident will serve
to show how perfect and almost infallible the sense
and its correlated instinct are, and at the same time
what a clumsy, blundering creature this beetle is.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Seeking a mate
</span>
</p>

<p>
Hearing a buzzing noise in a large unkept hedge,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
I went to the spot and found a stag trying to extricate
himself from some soft fern-fronds growing among
the brambles in which he had got entangled.  In the
end he succeeded, and, finally gaining a point where
there was nothing to obstruct his flight, he launched
himself on the air and flew straight away to a
distance of fifty yards; then he turned and commenced
flying backwards and forwards, travelling forty or
fifty yards one way and as many the other, until he
made a discovery; and struck motionless in his career,
he remained suspended for a moment or two, then
flew swiftly and straight as a bullet back to the
hedge from which he had so recently got away.  He
struck the hedge where it was broadest, at a distance
of about twenty yards or more from the point where
I had first found him, and running to the spot, I saw
that he had actually alighted within four or five
inches of a female concealed among the clustering
leaves.  On his approaching her she coyly moved from
him, climbing up and down and along the branchlets,
but for some time he continued very near her.
So far he had followed on her track, or by the same
branches and twigs over which she had passed, but
on her getting a little farther away and doubling
back, he attempted to reach her by a series of short
cuts, over the little bridges formed by innumerable
slender branches, and his short cuts in most cases
brought him against some obstruction; or else there
was a sudden bend in the branch, and he was taken
farther away.  When he had a chain of bridges or
turnings, he seemed fated to take the wrong one,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
and in spite of all his desperate striving to get nearer,
he only increased the distance between them.  The
level sun shone into the huge tangle of bramble,
briar, and thorn, with its hundreds of interlacing
branches and stringy stems, so that I was able to
keep both beetles in sight; but after I had watched
them for three-quarters of an hour, the sun departed,
and I too left them.  They were then nearly six
feet apart; and seeing what a labyrinth they
were in, I concluded that, strive how the enamoured
creature might, they would never, from the stag-beetle
point of view, be within measurable distance of
one another.
</p>

<p>
Something in the appearance of the big beetle,
both flying and when seen on the ground in his
wrathful, challenging attitude, strikes the rustics of
these parts as irresistibly comic.  When its heavy
flight brings it near the labourer in the fields, he
knocks it down with his cap, then grins at the sight
of the maltreated creature's amazement and
indignation.  However weary the ploughman may be
when he plods his homeward way, he will not be too
tired to indulge in this ancient practical joke.  When
the beetle's flight takes him by village or hamlet, the
children, playing together in the road, occupied with
some such simple pastime as rolling in the dust or
making little miniature hills of loose sand, are
suddenly thrown into a state of wild excitement, and,
starting to their feet, they run whooping after the
wanderer, throwing their caps to bring him down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A stag-beetle's fate
</span>
</p>

<p>
One evening at sunset, on coming to a forest gate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
through which I had to pass, I saw a stag-beetle
standing in his usual statuesque, angry or threatening
attitude in the middle of the road close to the
gate.  Doubtless some labourer who had arrived at
the gate earlier in the evening had struck it down
for fun and left it there.  By-and-by, I thought, he
will recover from the shock to his dignity and make
his way to some elevated point, from which he will
be able to start afresh on his wanderings in search
of a wife.  But it was not to be as I thought, for next
morning, on going by the same gate, I found the
remains of my beetle just where I had last seen
him&mdash;the legs, wing-cases, and the big, broad head with
horns attached.  The poor thing had remained
motionless too long, and had been found during the
evening by a hedgehog and devoured, all but the
uneatable parts.  On looking closely, I found that
the head was still alive; at a touch the antennæ&mdash;those
mysterious jointed rods, toothed like a comb
at their ends&mdash;began to wave up and down, and the
horns opened wide, like the jaws of an angry crab.
On placing a finger between them they nipped it
as sharply as if the creature had been whole and
uninjured.  Yet the body had been long devoured
and digested; and there was only this fragment left,
and, torn off with it, shall we say? a fragment of
intelligent life!
</p>

<p>
We always look on this divisibility of the
life-principle in some creatures with a peculiar
repugnance; and, like all phenomena that seem to
contradict the regular course of nature, it gives a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
shock to the mind.  We do not experience this feeling
with regard to plant life, and to the life of some of
the lower animal organisms, because we are more
familiar with the sight in these cases.  The trouble
to the mind is in the case of the higher life of sentient
and intelligent beings that have passions like our
own.  We see it even in some vertebrates, especially
in serpents, which are most tenacious of life.  Thus,
there is a recorded case of a pit viper, the head of
which was severed from the body by the person who
found it.  When the head was approached the jaws
opened and closed with a vicious snap, and when the
headless trunk was touched it instantly recoiled and
struck at the touching object.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Tenacity of life
</span>
</p>

<p>
Such cases are apt to produce in some minds a
sense as of something unfamiliar and uncanny behind
nature that mocks us.  But even those who are entirely
free from any such animistic feeling are strangely
disturbed at the spectacle, not only because it is
opposed to the order of nature (as the mind
apprehends it), but also because it contradicts the old
fixed eternal idea we all have, that life is compounded
of two things&mdash;the material body and the immaterial
spirit, which leavens and, in a sense, re-creates and
shines in and through the clay it is mixed with; and
that you cannot destroy the body without also
destroying or driving out that mysterious, subtle
principle.  Life was thus anciently likened to a seal,
which is two things in one&mdash;the wax and the impression
on it.  You cannot break the seal without also
destroying the impression, any more than you can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
break a pitcher without spilling the liquor in it.  In
such cases as those of the beetle and the serpent, it
would perhaps be better to liken life to a red, glowing
ember, which may be broken into pieces, and each
piece still burn and glow with its own portion of the
original heat.
</p>

<p>
The survival after death of something commonly
supposed to be dependent on vitality is another
phenomenon which, like that of the divisibility of
the life-principle, affects us disagreeably.  The
continued growth of the hair of dead men is an instance
in point.  It is, we know, an error, caused by the
shrinking of the flesh; and as for the accounts of
coffins being found full of hair when opened, they
are inventions, though still believed in by some
persons.  Another instance, which is not a fable, is
that of a serpent's skin.  When properly and quickly
dried after removal, it will retain its bright colours
for an indefinite time&mdash;in some cases for many years.
But at intervals the colours appear to fade, or become
covered with a misty whiteness; and the cause, as
one may see when the skin is rubbed or shaken, is
that the outer scales are being shed.  They come off
separately, and are very much thinner than when
the living serpent sheds his skin, and they grow
thinner with successive sheddings until they are
scarcely visible.  But at each shedding the skin
recovers its brightness.  One in my possession
continued shedding its scale-films in this way for about
ten years.  I used it for a book-marker and often had
it in my hands, but not until it ceased shedding its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
scale-coverings, and its original bright green colour
turned to dull blackish-green, did I get rid of the
feeling that it had some life in it.
</p>

<p>
But the most striking instance of the continuance
or survival long after death of what has seemed an
attribute or manifestation of life remains to be told.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A dead glow-worm's light
</span>
</p>

<p>
One cloudy, very dark night at Boldre, I was going
home across a heath with some girls from a farmhouse
where we had been visiting, when one of my
young companions cried out that she could see a
spark of fire on the road before us.  We then all
saw it&mdash;a small, steady, green light&mdash;but on lighting
a match and looking closely at the spot, nothing
could we see except the loose soil in the road.  When
the match went out the spark of green fire was there
still, and we searched again, turning the loose soil
with our fingers until we discovered the dried and
shrunken remains of a glow-worm of the previous
year.  It had been trodden into the sand, and the
sand driven into it, until it was hard to make out
any glow-worm shape or appearance in it.  It was
like a fragment of dry earth, and yet, so long as it
was in the dark, the small, brilliant green light
continued to shine from one end of it.  Yet this dried
old case must have been dead and blown about in
the dust for at least seven or eight months.
</p>

<p>
On going up to London I carried it with me in a
small box: there in a dark room it shone once more,
but the light was now much fainter, and on the
following evening there was no light.  For some
days I tried, by moistening it, by putting it out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
in the sun and wind, and in other ways, to bring
back the light, but did not succeed; and, convinced
at length that it would shine no more, I had the
feeling that life had at last gone out of that dry,
dusty fragment.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The little summer tragedies in Nature which we
see or notice are very few&mdash;not one in a thousand
of those that actually take place about us in a spot
like this, teeming with midsummer life.  A second
one, which impressed me at the time, had for its
scene a spot not more than eight minutes' walk
from that forest gate where the stag-beetle, too long
in cooling his wrath, had been overtaken by so
curious a destiny.  But before I relate this other
tragedy, I must describe the place and some of the
creatures I met there.  It was a point where heath
and wood meet, but do not mingle; where the marshy
stream that drains the heath flows down into the
wood, and the boggy ground sloping to the water
is overgrown with a mixture of plants of different
habits&mdash;lovers of a dry soil and of a wet&mdash;heather
and furze, coarse and fine grasses, bracken and bog
myrtle; and in the wettest spots there were patches
and round masses of rust-red and orange-yellow and
pale-grey lichen, and a few fragrant, shining, yellow
stars of the bog asphodel, although its flowering season
was nearly over.  It was a perfect wilderness, as wild
a bit of desert as one could wish to be in, where a
man could spy all day upon its shy inhabitants, and
no one would come and spy upon him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
</p>

<p>
Here, if anywhere, was my exulting thought when
I first beheld it, there should be adders for me.
There was a snakiness in the very look of the place,
and I could almost feel by anticipation the delightful
thrill in my nerves invariably experienced at the
sight of a serpent.  And as I went very cautiously
along, wishing for the eyes of a dragon-fly so as to
be able to see all round me, a coil of black and
yellow caught my sight at a distance of a few yards
ahead, and was no sooner seen than gone.  The spot
from which the shy creature had vanished was a
small, circular, natural platform on the edge of the
bank, surrounded with grass and herbage, and a
little dwarf, ragged furze; the platform was
composed of old, dead bracken and dry grass, and had
a smooth, flat surface, pressed down as if some
creature used it as a sleeping-place.  It was, I saw,
the favourite sleeping- or basking-place of an adder,
and by-and-by, or in a few hours' time, I should be
able to get a good view of the creature.  Later in the
day, on going back to the spot, I did find my adder
on its platform, and was able to get within three or
four yards, and watch it for some minutes before
it slipped gently down the bank and out of sight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Watching adders
</span>
</p>

<p>
This adder was a very large (probably gravid)
female, very bright in the sunshine, the broad,
zig-zag band an inky black on a straw-coloured ground.
On my third successful visit to the spot I was
agreeably surprised to find that my adder had not been
widowed by some fatal accident, nor left by her
wandering mate to spend the summer alone; for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
now there were two on the one platform, slumbering
peacefully side by side.  The new-comer, the male,
was a couple of inches shorter and a good deal
slimmer than his mate, and differed in colour; the
zigzag mark was intensely black, as in the other,
but the ground colour was a beautiful copper red;
he was, I think, the handsomest red adder I have seen.
</p>

<p>
On my subsequent visits to the spot I found
sometimes one and sometimes both; and I observed them
a good deal at different distances.  One way was to
look at them from a distance of fifteen to twenty
yards through a binocular magnifying nine diameters,
which produced in me the fascinating illusion of
being in the presence of venomous serpents of a
nobler size than we have in this country.  The glasses
were for pleasure only.  When I watched them for
profit with my unaided eyes, I found it most
convenient to stand at a distance of three or four yards;
but often I moved cautiously up to the raised platform
they reposed on, until, by bending a little
forward, I could look directly down upon them.
</p>

<p>
When we first catch sight of an adder lying at rest
in the sun, it strikes us as being fast asleep, so
motionless is it; but that it ever does really sleep with the
sun shining into its round, lidless, brilliant eyes is
hardly to be believed.  The immobility which we
note at first does not continue long; watch the adder
lying peacefully in the sun, and you will see that at
intervals of a very few minutes, and sometimes as
often as once a minute, he quietly changes his position.
Now he draws his concentric coils a little closer,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
now spreads them more abroad; by-and-by the whole
body is extended to a sinuous band, then disposed
in the form of a letter S, or a simple horseshoe
figure, and sometimes the head rests on the body
and sometimes on the ground.  The gentle, languid
movements of the creature changing his position at
intervals are like those of a person reclining in a hot bath,
who occasionally moves his body and limbs to renew
and get the full benefit of the luxurious sensation.
</p>

<p>
That the two adders could see me when I stood
over them, or at a distance of three or four yards,
or even more, is likely; but it is certain that they did
not regard me as a living thing, or anything to be
disturbed at, but saw me only as a perfectly
motionless object which had grown imperceptibly on their
vision, and was no more than a bush, or stump, or
tree.  Nevertheless, I became convinced that always
after standing for a time near them my presence
produced a disturbing effect.  It is, perhaps, the case
that we are not all contained within our visible bodies,
but have our own atmosphere about us&mdash;something
of us which is outside of us, and may affect other
creatures.  More than that, there may be a subtle
current which goes out and directly affects any
creature (or person) which we regard for any length
of time with concentrated attention.  This is one of
the things about which we know nothing, or, at all
events, learn nothing from our masters, and most
scientists would say that it is a mere fancy; but in
this instance it was plain to see that always after
a time something began to produce a disturbing effect
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
on the adders.  This would first show itself in a slight
restlessness, a movement of the body as if it had
been breathed upon, increasing until they would be
ill at ease all the time, and at length they would
slip quietly away to hide under the bank.
</p>

<p>
The following incident will show that they were
not disturbed at seeing me standing near, assuming
that they could or did see me.  On one of my visits
I took some pieces of scarlet ribbon to find out by
an experiment if there was any truth in the old belief
that the sight of scarlet will excite this serpent to
anger.  I approached them in the usual cautious way,
until I was able, bending forward, to look down upon
them reposing unalarmed on their bed of dry fern;
then, gradually putting one hand out until it was
over them, I dropped from it first one then another
piece of silk so that they fell gently upon the edge
of the platform.  The adders must have seen these
bright objects so close to them, yet they did not
suddenly draw back their heads, nor exsert their
tongues, nor make the least movement, but it was
as if a dry, light, dead leaf, or a ball of thistledown,
had floated down and settled near them, and they
had not heeded it.
</p>

<p>
In the same way they probably saw me, and it
was as if they had seen me not, since they did not
heed my motionless figure; but that they always
felt my presence after a time I felt convinced, for
not only when I stood close to and looked down
upon them, but also at a distance of four to eight
yards, after gazing fixedly at them for some minutes,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
the change, the tremor, would appear, and in a little
while they would steal away.
</p>

<p>
Enough has been said to show how much I liked
the company of these adders, even when I knew that
my presence disturbed their placid lives in some
indefinable way.  They were indeed more to me
than all the other adders, numbering about a score,
which I had found at their favourite basking-places
in the neighbourhood.  For they were often to be
found in that fragrant, sequestered spot where their
home was; and they were two together, of different
types, both beautiful, and by observing them day
by day I increased my knowledge of their kind.
We do not know very much about "the life and
conversation" of adders, having been too much
occupied in "bruising" their shining beautiful bodies
beneath our ironshod heels, and with sticks and stones,
to attend to such matters.  So absorbed was I in
contemplating or else thinking about them at that
spot that I was curiously indifferent to the other
creatures&mdash;little lizards, and butterflies, and many
young birds brought by their parents to the willows
and alders that shaded the stream.  All day the
birds dozed on their gently swaying perches, chirping
at intervals to be fed; and near by a tree-pipit
had his stand, and sang and sang when most songsters
were silent, but I paid no attention even to
his sweet strains.  Two or three hundred yards away,
up the stream on a boggy spot, a pair of pewits
had their breeding-place.  They were always there,
and invariably on my appearance they rose up and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
came to me, and, winnowing the air over my head,
screamed their loudest.  But I took no notice, and
was not annoyed, knowing that their most piercing
cries would have no effect on the adders, since their
deaf ears heard nothing, and their brilliant eyes saw
next to nothing, of all that was going on about them.
After vexing their hearts in vain for a few minutes
the pewits would go back to their own ground,
then peace would reign once more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A dead young pewit
</span>
</p>

<p>
One day I was surprised and a little vexed to find
that the pewits had left their own ground to come
and establish themselves on the bog within forty
yards of the spot where I was accustomed to take
my stand when observing the adders.  Their anxiety
at my presence had now become so intensified that
it was painful to witness.  I concluded that they had
led their nearly grown-up young to that spot, and
sincerely hoped that they would be gone on the
morrow.  But they remained there five days; and
as their solicitude and frantic efforts to drive me
away were renewed on each visit, they were a source
of considerable annoyance.  On the fourth day I
accidentally discovered their secret.  If I had not
been so taken up with the adders, I might have
guessed it.  Going over the ground I came upon a
dead full-grown young pewit, raised a few inches
above the earth by the heather it rested on, its head
dropped forward, its motionless wings partly open.
</p>

<p>
Usually at the moment of death a bird beats
violently with its wings, and after death the wings
remain half open.  This was how the pewit had died,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
the wings half folded.  Picking it up, I saw that it had
been dead several days, though the carrion beetles
had not attacked it, owing to its being several inches
above the ground.  It had, in fact, no doubt been
already dead when I first found the old pewits settled
at that spot; yet during those four hot, long summer
days they had been in a state of the most intense
anxiety for the safety of these dead remains!  This
is to my mind not only a very pathetic spectacle,
but one of the strangest facts in animal life.  The
reader may say that it is not at all strange, since it
is very common.  It is most strange to me because
it is very common, since if it were rare we could say
that it was due to individual aberration, or resulted
through the bluntness of some sense or instinct.
What is wonderful and almost incredible is that the
higher vertebrates have no instinct to guide them in
such a case as I have described, and no inherited
knowledge of death.  To make of Nature a person,
we may see that in spite of her providential care for
all her children, and wise ordering of their lives
down to the minutest detail, she has yet failed in
this one thing.  Her only provision is that the dead
shall be speedily devoured; but they are not thus
removed in numberless instances; a very familiar
one is the sight of living and dead young birds, the
dead often in a state of decay, lying together in one
nest: and here we cannot but see that the dead
become a burden and a danger to the living.  Birds
and mammals are alike in this.  They will call, and
wait for, and bring food to, and try to rouse the dead
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
young or mate; day and night they will keep guard
over it and waste themselves in fighting to save it
from their enemies.  Yet we can readily believe that
an instinct fitted to save an animal from all this
vain excitement, and labour, and danger, would be
of infinite advantage to the species that possessed it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Animals and their dead
</span>
</p>

<p>
In some social hymenopterous insects we see that
the dead are removed; it would be impossible for
ants to exist in communities numbering many thousands
and tens of thousands of members crowded in
a small space without such a provision.  The dead
ant is picked up by the first worker that happens to
come that way and discovers it, and carried out and
thrown away.  Probably some chemical change which
takes place in the organism on the cessation of life
and makes it offensive to the living has given rise
to this healthy instinct.  The dead ant is not indeed
seen as a dead fellow-being, but as so much rubbish,
or "matter in the wrong place," and is accordingly
removed.  We can confidently say that this is not a
knowledge of death, from what has been observed
of the behaviour of ants on the death of some highly
regarded individual in the nest&mdash;a queen, for
instance.  On this point I will quote a passage from
the Rev. William Gould's <i>Account of English Ants</i>,
dated 1747.  His small book may be regarded as a
classic, at all events by naturalists; albeit the
editors of our <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> have
not thought proper to give him a place in that work,
in which so many obscurities, especially of the
nineteenth century, have had their little lives recorded.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
</p>

<p>
It may be remarked in passing that the passage to
be quoted is a very good sample of the style of our
oldest entomologist, the first man in England to
observe the habits of insects.  His small volume dates
many years before the <i>Natural History of Selborne</i>,
and his style, it will be seen, is very different from
that of Gilbert White.  We know from Lord Avebury's
valuable book on the habits of ants that Gould was
not mistaken in these remarkable observations.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In whatever Apartment a Queen Ant condescends to be
present, she commands Obedience and Respect.  An universal
Gladness spreads itself through the whole Cell, which is expressed
by particular Acts of Joy and Exultation.  They have a peculiar
Way of skipping, leaping, and standing upon their Hind Legs,
and prancing with the others.  These Frolicks they make use of,
both to congratulate each other when they meet, and to show
their Regard for the Queen....  Howsoever romantick this
Description may appear, it may easily be proved by an obvious
Experiment.  If you place a Queen Ant with her Retinue under a
Glass, you will in a few Moments be convinced of the Honour
they pay, and Esteem they entertain for her.  There cannot
be a more remarkable Instance than what happened to a Black
Queen, the beginning of last Spring.  I had placed her with a
large Retinue in a sliding Box, in the Cover of which was an
Opening sufficient for the Workers to pass to and fro, but so narrow
as to confine the Queen.  A Corps was constantly in waiting and
surrounded her, whilst others went out in search of Provisions.
By some Misfortune she died; the Ants, as if not apprised of
her Death, continued their Obedience.  They even removed her
from one Part of the Box to another, and treated her with the
same Court and Formality as if she had been alive.  This lasted
two Months, at the End of which, the Cover being open, they
forsook the Box, and carried her off.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Two days after I found the dead pewit the parent
birds disappeared; and a little later I paid my last
visit to the adders, and left them with the greatest
reluctance, for they had not told me a hundredth
part of their unwritten history.

<p>
The nightingale ceases singing about 18th or
20th June.  A bird here and there may sing
later; I occasionally hear one as late as the
first days of July.  And because the nightingale is
not so numerous as the other singers, and his song
attracts more attention, we get the idea that his
musical period is soonest over.  Yet several other
species come to the end of their vocal season quite
as early, or but little later.  If it be an extremely
abundant species, as in the case of the willow-wren,
we will hear a score or fifty sing for every
nightingale.  Blackcap and garden warbler, whitethroat
and lesser whitethroat, are nearly silent, too, at the
beginning of July; and altogether it seems to be
the rule that the species oftenest heard after June
are the most abundant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
</p>

<p>
The woodland silence increases during July and
August, not only because the singing season is ended,
but also because the birds are leaving the woods:
that darkness and closeness which oppresses us when
we walk in the deep shade is not congenial to them;
besides, food is less plentiful than in the open places,
where the sun shines and the wind blows.
</p>

<p>
Woods, again, vary greatly in character and the
degree of attractiveness they have for birds: the
copse and spinney keep a part of their population
through the hottest months; and coming to large
woods the oak is never oppressive like the beech
and other deciduous trees.  It spreads its branches
wide, and has wide spaces which let in the light
and air; grass and undergrowth flourish beneath it,
and, better than all, it abounds in bird food on its
foliage above all trees.
</p>

<p>
My favourite woods were almost entirely of oak
with a holly undergrowth, and at some points oaks
were mixed with firs.  They were never gloomy nor
so silent as most woods; but in July, as a rule, one
had to look for the birds, since they were no longer
distributed through the wood as in the spring and
early summer, but were congregated at certain points.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mixed bird-companies
</span>
</p>

<p>
Most persons are familiar with those companies of
small birds which form in woods in winter, composed
of tits of all species, with siskins, goldcrests, and
sometimes other kinds.  The July gatherings are
larger, include more species, and do not travel
incessantly like the winter companies.  They are
composed of families&mdash;parent birds and their young,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
lately out of the nest, brought to the oaks to be fed
on caterpillars.  It may be that their food is more
abundant at certain points, but it is also probable
that their social disposition causes them to
congregate.  Walking in the silent woods you begin to
hear them at a considerable distance ahead&mdash;a great
variety of sounds, mostly of that shrill, sharp,
penetrative character which is common to many young
passerine birds when calling to be fed.  The birds
will sometimes be found distributed over an acre
of ground, a family or two occupying every large
oak tree&mdash;tits, finches, warblers, the tree-creeper,
nuthatch, and the jay.  What, one asks, is the jay
doing in such company?  He is feeding at the same
table, and certainly not on them.  All, jays included,
are occupied with the same business, minutely
examining each cluster of leaves, picking off every
green caterpillar, and extracting the chrysalids from
every rolled-up leaf.  The airy little leaf-warblers
and the tits do this very deftly; the heavier birds
are obliged to advance with caution along the twig
until by stretching the neck they can reach their
prey lurking in the green cluster, and thrust their
beaks into each little green web-fastened cylinder.
But all are doing the same thing in pretty much the
same way.  While the old birds are gathering food,
the young, sitting in branches close by, are
incessantly clamouring to be fed, their various calls
making a tempest of shrill and querulous sounds in
the wood.  And the shrillest of all are the long-tailed
tits; these will not sit still and wait like the others,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
but all, a dozen or fifteen to a brood, hurry after
their busy parents, all the time sending out those
needles of sound in showers.  Of hard-billed birds
the chaffinch, as usual, was the most numerous, but
there were, to my surprise, many yellowhammers;
all these, like the rest, with their newly brought out
young.  The presence of the hawfinch was another
surprise; and here I noticed that the hunger call of
the young hawfinch is the loudest of all&mdash;a measured,
powerful, metallic chirp, heard high above the
shrill hubbub.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Caterpillars and ants
</span>
</p>

<p>
Watching one of these busy companies of small
birds at work, one is amazed at the thought of the
abundance of larval insect life in these oak woods.
The caterpillars must be devoured in tens of
thousands every day for some weeks, yet when the time
comes one is amazed again at the numbers that have
survived to know a winged life.  On July evenings
with the low sun shining on the green oaks at this
place I have seen the trees covered as with a pale
silvery mist&mdash;a mist composed of myriads of small
white and pale-grey moths fluttering about the oak
foliage.  Yet it is probable that all the birds eat is
but a small fraction of the entire number destroyed.
The rapacious insects are in myriads too, and are
most of them at war with the soft-bodied caterpillars.
The earth under the bed of dead leaves is
full of them, and the surface is hunted over all day
by the wood or horse ants&mdash;<i>Formica rufa</i>.  One day,
standing still to watch a number of these ants moving
about in all directions over the ground, I saw a green
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
geometer caterpillar fall from an oak leaf above to
the earth, and no sooner had it dropped than an ant
saw and attacked it, seizing it at one end of its body
with his jaws.  The caterpillar threw itself into a
horseshoe form, and then, violently jerking its body
round, flung the ant away to a distance of a couple
of inches.  But the attack was renewed, and three
times the ant was thrown violently off; then another
ant came, and he, too, was twice thrown off; then a
third ant joined in the fight, and when all three had
fastened their jaws on their victim the struggle ceased,
and the caterpillar was dragged away.  That is the
fate of most caterpillars that come to the ground.
But the ants ascend the trees; you see them going
up and coming down in thousands, and you find
on examination that they distribute themselves over
the whole tree, even to the highest and farthest
terminal twigs.  And their numbers are incalculable&mdash;here
in the Forest, at all events.  Not only are their
communities large, numbering hundreds of thousands
in a nest, but their nests here are in hundreds, and it
is not uncommon to find them in groups, three or
four up to eight or ten, all within a distance of a few
yards of one another.
</p>

<p>
I had thought to write more, a whole chapter in
fact, on this fascinating and puzzling insect&mdash;our
"noble ant," as our old ant-lover Gould called it;
but I have had to throw out that and much besides in
order to keep this book within reasonable dimensions.
</p>

<p>
There is another noise of birds in all woods
and copses in the silent season which is familiar to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
everyone&mdash;the sudden excited cries they utter at the
sight of some prowling animal&mdash;fox, cat, or stoat.
Even in the darkest, stillest woods these little tempests
of noise occasionally break out, for no sooner does
one bird utter the alarm cry than all within hearing
hasten to the spot to increase the tumult.  These
tempests are of two kinds&mdash;the greater and lesser;
in the first jays, blackbirds, and missel-thrushes take
part, the magpie too, if he is in the wood, and almost
invariably the outcry is caused by the appearance
of one of the animals just named.  In the smaller
outbreaks, which are far more frequent, none of these
birds take any part, not even the excitable blackbird,
in spite of his readiness to make a noise on the
least provocation.  Only the smaller birds are
concerned here, from the chaffinch down; and the weasel
is, I believe, almost always the exciting cause.  If
it be as I think, a curious thing is that birds like the
chaffinch and the tits, which have their nests placed
out of its reach, should be so overcome at the sight
of this minute creature which hunts on the ground,
and which blackbirds and jays refuse to notice in
spite of the outrageous din of the finches.  The
chaffinch is invariably first and loudest in these
outbreaks; a dozen or twenty times a day, even in
July and August, you will hear his loud passionate
<i>pink-pink</i> calling on all of his kind to join him, and
by-and-by, if you can succeed in getting to the
spot, you will hear other species joining in&mdash;the
girding of oxeye and blue tit, the angry, percussive
note of the wren, the low wailing of the robin, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
the still sadder dunnock, and the small plaintive
cries of the tree-warblers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Weasel and small birds
</span>
</p>

<p>
What an idle demonstration, what a fuss about
nothing it seems!  The minute weasel is on the track
of a vole or a wood-mouse and cannot harm the
birds.  Yes, he can take the nestlings from the robin's
and willow-wren's nests, and from other nests built
on the ground, but what has the chaffinch to do with
it all?  Can it be that there is some fatal weakness
in birds, in spite of their wings, in this bird especially,
such as exists in voles, and mice, and rabbits, and in
frogs and lizards, which brings them down to
destruction, and of which they are in some way conscious?
Some months ago there was a correspondence in the
<i>Field</i> which touched upon this very subject.  One
gentleman wrote that he had found three freshly-killed
adult cock chaffinches in a weasel's nest, and
he asked in consequence how this small creature
that hunts on the ground could be so successful
in capturing so alert and vigorous a bird as
this finch.
</p>

<p>
For a long time before this correspondence appeared
I had been trying to find out the secret of the matter,
but the weasel has keen senses, and it is hard to see
and follow his movements in a copse without
alarming him.  One day, over a year ago, near Boldre, I
was fortunate enough to hear a commotion of the
lesser kind at a spot where I could steal upon
without alarming the little beast.  There was an oak
tree, with some scanty thorn-bushes growing beside
the trunk, and stealing quietly to the spot I peeped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
through the screening thorns, and saw a weasel
lying coiled round, snakewise, at the roots of the
oak in a bed of dead leaves.  He was grinning and
chattering at the birds, his whole body quivering
with excitement.  Close to him on the twigs above
the birds were perched, and fluttering from twig to
twig&mdash;chaffinches, wrens, robins, dunnocks, oxeyes,
and two or three willow-wrens and chiffchaffs.  The
chaffinches were the most excited, and were nearest
to him.  Suddenly, after a few moments, the weasel
began wriggling and spinning round with such
velocity that his shape became indistinguishable, and
he appeared as a small round red object violently
agitated, his rapid motions stirring up the dead
leaves so that they fluttered about him.  Then he
was still again, but chattering and quivering, then
again the violent motion, and each time he made
this extraordinary movement the excitement and
cries of the birds increased and they fluttered closer
down on the twigs.  Unluckily, just when I was on
the point of actually witnessing the end of this
strange little drama&mdash;a chaffinch, I am sure, would
have been the victim&mdash;the little flat-headed wretch
became aware of my presence, not five yards from
him, and springing up he scuttled into hiding.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fascination
</span>
</p>

<p>
If, as I think, certain species of birds are so thrown
off their mental balance by the sight of this enemy as
to come in their frenzy down to be taken by him, it
is clear that he fascinates&mdash;to use the convenient old
word&mdash;in two different ways, or that his furred and
feathered victims are differently affected.  In the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
case of the rabbits and of the small rodents, we see
that they recognise the dangerous character of their
pursuer and try their best to escape from him, but
that they cannot attain their normal speed&mdash;they
cannot run as they do from a man, or dog, or other
enemy, or as they run ordinarily when chasing one
another.  Yet it is plain to anyone who has watched
a rabbit followed by a stoat that they strain every
nerve to escape, and, conscious of their weakness,
are on the brink of despair and ready to collapse.
The rabbit's appearance when he is being followed,
even when his foe is at a distance behind, his
trembling frame, little hopping movements, and agonising
cries, which may be heard distinctly three or four
hundred yards away, remind us of our own state
in a bad dream, when some terrible enemy, or
some nameless horror, is coming swiftly upon us;
when we must put forth our utmost speed to escape
instant destruction, yet have a leaden weight on
our limbs that prevents us from moving.
</p>

<p>
I have often watched rabbits hunted by stoats,
and recently, at Beaulieu, I watched a vole hunted
by a weasel, and it was simply the stoat and rabbit
hunt in little.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Weasel and vole
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is a typical case, and I will describe just what
I saw, and saw very well.  I was on the hard, white
road between Beaulieu village and Hilltop, when the
little animal&mdash;a common field vole&mdash;came out from
the hedge and ran along the road, and knowing from
his appearance that he was being pursued, I stood
still to see the result.  He had a very odd look:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
instead of a smooth-haired little mouse-like creature
running smoothly and swiftly over the bare ground,
he was all hunched up, his hair standing on end like
bristles, and he moved in a series of heavy painful
hops.  Before he had gone half a dozen yards, the
weasel appeared at the point where the vole had
come out, following by scent, his nose close to the
ground; but on coming into the open road he lifted
his head and caught sight of the straining vole, and
at once dashed at and overtook him.  A grip, a little
futile squeal, and all was over, and the weasel
disappeared into the hedge.  But his mate had crossed
the road a few moments before&mdash;I had seen her run
by me&mdash;and he wanted to follow her, and so presently
he emerged again with the vole in his mouth, and
plucking up courage ran across close to me.  I stood
motionless until he was near my feet, then suddenly
stamped on the hard road, and this so startled him
that he dropped his prey and scuttled into cover.
Very soon he came out again, and, seeing me so
still, made a dash to recover his vole, when I stamped
again, and he lost it again and fled; but only to
return for another try, until he had made at least a
dozen attempts.  Then he gave it up, and peering at
me in a bird-like way from the roadside grass began
uttering a series of low, sorrowful sounds, so low
indeed that if I had been more than six yards from
him they would have been inaudible&mdash;low, and soft,
and musical, and very sad, until he quite melted my
heart, and I turned away, leaving him to his vole,
feeling as much ashamed of myself as if I had teased
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
a pretty bright-eyed little child by keeping his cake
or apple until I had made him cry.
</p>

<p>
With regard to these fatal weaknesses in birds,
mammals and reptiles, which we see are confined to
certain species, they always strike us as out of the
order of nature, or as abnormal, if the word may be
used in such a connection.  Perhaps it can be properly
used.  I remember that Herodotus, in his <i>History of
Egypt</i>, relates that when a fire broke out in any city
in that country, the people did not concern
themselves about extinguishing it; their whole anxiety
was to prevent the cats from rushing into the flames
and destroying themselves.  To this end the people
would occupy all the approaches to the burning
building, forming a cordon, as it were, to keep the
cats back; but in spite of all they could do, some of
them would get through, and rush into the flames
and die.  The omniscient learned person may tell me
that Herodotus is the Father of Lies, if he likes, and
is anxious to say something witty and original; but
I believe this story of the cats, since not Herodotus,
nor any Egyptian who was his informant, would or
could have invented such a tale.  Believing it, I can
only explain it on the assumption that this Egyptian
race of cats had become subject to a fatal weakness,
a hypnotic effect caused by the sight of a great blaze.
In like manner, if our chaffinch gets too much excited
and finally comes down to be destroyed by a weasel,
when he catches sight of that small red animal, or
sees him going through that strange antic performance
which I witnessed, it does not follow that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
weakness or abnormality is universal in the species.
It may be only in a race.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Strange weaknesses
</span>
</p>

<p>
Again, with regard to rabbits: when hunted by a
stoat they endeavour to fly, but cannot, and are
destroyed owing to that strange&mdash;one might almost
say unnatural&mdash;weakness; but I can believe that if
a colony of British rabbits were to inhabit, for a
good many generations, some distant country where
there are no stoats, this weakness would be outgrown.
It is probable that, even in this stoat-infested
country, not all individuals are subject to such a
failing, and that, in those which have it, it differs in
degree.  If it is a weakness, a something inimical, then it
is reasonable to believe that nature works to eliminate
it, whether by natural selection or some other means.
</p>

<p>
The main point is the origin of this flaw in certain
races, and perhaps species.  How comes it that
certain animals should, in certain circumstances, act
in a definite way, as by instinct, to the detriment of
their own and the advantage of some other species&mdash;in
this case that of a direct and well-known enemy?
It is a mystery, one which, so far as I know, has not
yet been looked into.  A small ray of light may be
thrown on the matter, if we consider the fact of those
strange weaknesses and mental abnormalities in our
own species, which are supposed to have their origin
in violent emotional and other peculiar mental states
in one of our parents.  "The fathers have eaten sour
grapes, and their children's teeth are set on edge,"
is one of the old proverbs quoted by Ezekiel.  I
know of one unfortunate person who, if he but sees
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
a lemon squeezed, or a child biting an unripe-looking
fruit, has his teeth so effectually set on edge, that he
cannot put food into his mouth for some time after.
Here is a farmer, a big, strong, healthy man, who
himself works on his farm like any labourer, who,
if he but catches sight of any ophidian&mdash;adder, or
harmless grass snake, or poor, innocent blindworm&mdash;instantly
lets fall the implements from his hands,
and stands trembling, white as a ghost, for some
time; then, finally, he goes back to the house, slowly
and totteringly, like some very aged, feeble invalid,
and dropping on to a bed, he lies nerveless for the
rest of that day.  Night and sleep restore him to
his normal state.
</p>

<p>
I give this one of scores of similar cases which I
have found.  Such things are indeed very common.
But how does the fact of pre-natal suggestion help
us to get the true meaning of such a phenomenon as
fascination?  It does not help us if we consider it by
itself.  It is a fact that "freaks" of this kind, mental
and physical, are transmissible, but that helps us
little&mdash;the abnormal individual has the whole normal
race against him.  Thus, in reference to the cat story
in Herodotus, here in a Hampshire village, a mile or
two from where I am writing this chapter, a cottage
took fire one evening, and when the villagers were
gathered on the spot watching the progress of the
fire, some pigs&mdash;a sow with her young ones&mdash;appeared
on the scene and dashed into the flames.  The people
rushed to the rescue, and with some difficulty pulled
the pigs out; and finally hurdles had to be brought
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
and placed in the way of the sow to prevent her
getting back, so anxious was she to treat the villagers
to roast pig.
</p>

<p>
This is a case of the hypnotic effect of fire on
animals, and perhaps many similar cases would be
found if looked for.  We know that most animals
are strangely attracted by fire at night, but they
fear it too, and keep at a proper distance.  It draws
and disturbs but does not upset their mental balance.
But how it came about that a whole race of cats in
ancient Egypt were thrown off their balance and
were always ready to rush into destruction like the
Hampshire pigs, is a mystery.
</p>

<p>
To return to fascination.  Let us (to personify)
remember that Nature in her endeavours to safeguard
all and every one of her creatures has given
them the passion of fear in various degrees, according
to their several needs, and in the greatest degree to
her persecuted weaklings; and this emotion, to be
efficient, must be brought to the extreme limit,
beyond which it becomes debilitating and is a positive
danger, even to betraying to destruction the life it
was designed to save.  Let us consider this fact in
connection with that of pre-natal suggestion&mdash;of
weak species frequently excited to an extremity of
fear at the sight, familiar to them, of some deadly
enemy, and the possible effect of that constantly
recurring violent disturbance and image of terror
on the young that are to be.
</p>

<p>
The guess may go for what it is worth.  We know
that the susceptibility of certain animals&mdash;the vole
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
and the frog, let us say&mdash;to fascination, is like nothing
else in animal life, since it is a great disadvantage
to the species, a veritable weakness, which might
even be called a disease; and that it must therefore
have its cause in too great a strain on the system
somewhere; and we know, too, that it is inheritable.
But the facts are too few, since no one has yet taken
pains to collect data on the matter.  There is a good
deal of material lying about in print; and I am
astonished at many things I hear from intelligent
keepers, and other persons who see a good deal of
wild life, bearing on this subject.  But I do not now
propose to follow it any further.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I went into the oak wood one morning, and, finding
it unusually still, betook myself to a spot where I had
often found the birds gathered.  It was a favourite
place, where there was running water and very large
trees standing wide apart, with a lawn-like green turf
beneath them.  This green space was about half an
acre in extent, and was surrounded by a thicker wood
of oak and holly, with an undergrowth of brambles.
Here I found a dead squirrel lying on the turf under
one of the biggest oaks, looking exceedingly
conspicuous with the bright morning sun shining on him.
</p>

<p>
A poor bag! the reader may say, but it was the
day of small things at the end of July, and this dead
creature gave me something to think about.  How in
the name of wonder came it to be dead at that peaceful
place, where no gun was fired!  I could not believe
that he had died, for never had I seen a finer,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
glossier-coated, better-nourished-looking squirrel.  "Whiter
than pearls are his teeth," were Christ's words in the
legend when His followers looked with disgust and
abhorrence at a dead dog lying in the public way.
This dead animal had more than pearly teeth to
admire; he was actually beautiful to the sight,
lying graceful in death on the moist green sward in
his rich chestnut reds and flower-like whiteness.  The
wild, bright-eyed, alert little creature&mdash;it seemed a
strange and unheard-of thing that he, of all the
woodland people, should be lying there, motionless,
not stiffened yet and scarcely cold.
</p>

<p>
A keeper in Hampshire told me that he once saw
a squirrel accidentally kill itself in a curious way.
The keeper was walking on a hard road, and noticed
the squirrel high up in the topmost branches of the
trees overhead, bounding along from branch to
branch before him, and by-and-by, failing to grasp
the branch it had aimed at, it fell fifty or sixty feet
to the earth, and was stone-dead when he picked it
up from the road.  But such accidents must be
exceedingly rare in the squirrel's life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fleas large and small
</span>
</p>

<p>
Looking closely at my dead squirrel to make sure
that he had no external hurt, I was surprised to find
its fur peopled with lively black fleas, running about
as if very much upset at the death of their host.
These fleas were to my eyes just like <i>pulex irritans</i>&mdash;our
own flea; but it is doubtful that it was the same,
as we know that a great many animals have their
own species to tease them.  Now, I have noticed that
some very small animals have very small fleas; and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
that, one would imagine, is as it should be, since fleas
are small to begin with, because they cannot afford to
be large, and the flea that would be safe on a dog
would be an unsuitable parasite for so small a creature
as a mouse.  The common shrew is an example.  It
has often happened that when in an early morning
walk I have found one lying dead on the path or
road and have touched it, out instantly a number of
fleas have jumped.  And on touching it again, there
may be a second and a third shower.  These fleas,
parasitical on so minute a mammal, are themselves
minute&mdash;pretty sherry-coloured little creatures, not
half so big as the dog's flea.  It appears to be a habit
of some wild fleas, when the animal they live on dies
and grows cold, to place themselves on the surface
of the fur and to hop well away when shaken.  But
we do not yet know very much about their lives.
Huxley once said that we were in danger of being
buried under our accumulated monographs.  There
is, one is sorry to find, no monograph on the fleas; a
strange omission, when we consider that we have, as
the life-work of an industrious German, a big
handsome quarto, abundantly illustrated, on the more
degraded and less interesting <i>Pedicularia</i>.
</p>

<p>
The multitude of fleas, big and black, on my dead
squirrel, seemed a ten-times bigger puzzle than the
one of the squirrel's death.  For how had they got
there?  They were not hatched and brought up on
the squirrel: they passed their life as larvæ on the
ground, among the dead leaves, probably feeding on
decayed organic matter.  How did so many of them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
succeed in getting hold of so very sprightly and
irritable a creature, who lives mostly high up in the
trees, and does not lie about on the ground?  Can
it be that fleas&mdash;those proper to the squirrel&mdash;swarm
on the ground in the woods, and that without feeding
on mammalian blood they are able to propagate and
keep up their numbers?  These questions have yet
to be answered.
</p>

<p>
It struck me at last that these sprightly parasites
might have been the cause of the squirrel's coming
to grief; that, driven to desperation by their
persecutions, he had cast himself down from some topmost
branch, and so put an end to the worry with his life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A squirrel's disposition
</span>
</p>

<p>
Squirrels abound in these woods, and but for
parasites and their own evil tempers they might be happy
all the time.  But they are explosive and tyrannical
to an almost insane degree; and this may be an
effect of the deleterious substances they are fond of
eating.  They will feast on scarlet and orange
agarics&mdash;lovely things to look at, but deadly to creatures
that are not immune.  A prettier spectacle than two
squirrels fighting is not to be seen among the oaks.
So swift are they, so amazingly quick in their
doublings, in feints, attack, flight, and chase; moving
not as though running on trees and ground, but as
if flying and gliding; and so rarely do they come
within touching distance of one another, that the
delighted looker-on might easily suppose that it is
all in fun.  In their most truculent moods, in their
fiercest fights, they cannot cease to be graceful in
all their motions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
</p>

<p>
A common action of squirrels, when excited, of
throwing things down, has been oddly misinterpreted
by some observers who have written about it.  Here
I have often watched a squirrel, madly excited at my
presence when I have stopped to watch him, dancing
about and whisking his tail, scolding in a variety of
tones, and emitting that curious sound which reminds
one of the chattering cry of fieldfares when alarmed; and
finally tearing off the loose bark with his little hands
and teeth, and biting, too, at twigs and leaves so as to
cause them to fall in showers.  The little pot boils over
in that way, and that's all there is to be said about it.
</p>

<p>
Walking among the oaks one day in early winter
when the trees were nearly leafless, I noticed a squirrel
sitting very quietly on a branch; and though he did
not get excited, he began to move away before me,
stopping at intervals and sitting still to watch me
for a few moments.  He was a trifle suspicious, and
nothing more.  In this way he went on for some
distance, and by-and-by came to a long horizontal
branch thickly clothed with long lichen on its upper
sides, and instantly his demeanour changed.  He was
all excitement, and bounding along the branch he
eagerly began to look for something, sniffing and
scratching with his paws, and presently he pulled
out a nut which had been concealed in a crevice
under the lichen, and sitting up, he began cracking
and eating it, taking no further notice of me.  The
sudden change in him, the hurried search for something,
and the result, seemed to throw some light on
the question of the animal's memory with reference
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
to his habit of hiding food.  It is one common to
a great number of rodents, and to many of the
higher mammals&mdash;Canidæ and Felidæ, and to many
birds, including most, if not all, the Corvidæ.
</p>

<p>
When the food is hidden away here, there, and
everywhere, we know from observation that in
innumerable instances it is never found, and probably
never looked for again; and of the squirrel we are
accustomed to say that he no sooner hides a nut
than he forgets all about it.  Doubtless he does, and
yet something may bring it back to his mind.  In
this matter I think there is a considerable difference
between the higher mammals, cats and dogs, for
instance, and the rodents; I think the dog has a
better or more highly developed memory.  Thus, I
have seen a dog looking enviously at another who had
got a bone, and after gazing at him with watering
mouth for some time, suddenly turn round and go
off at a great pace to a distant part of the ground,
and there begin digging, and presently pull out a
bone of his own, which he had no doubt forgotten all
about until he was feelingly reminded of it.  I doubt
if a squirrel would ever rise to this height; but on
coming by chance to a spot with very marked features,
where he had once hidden a nut, then I think the
sight of the place might bring back the old impression.
</p>

<p>
I have often remarked when riding a nervous
horse, that he will invariably become alarmed, and
sometimes start at nothing, on arriving at some spot
where something had once occurred to frighten him.
The sight of the spot brings up the image of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
object or sound that startled him; or, to adopt a
later interpretation of memory, the past event is
reconstructed in his mind.  Again, I have noticed
with dogs, when one is brought to a spot where on
a former occasion he has battled with or captured
some animal, or where he has met with some
exciting adventure, he shows by a sudden change in
his manner, in eyes and twitching nose, that it has
all come back to him, and he appears as if looking
for its instant repetition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The lower kind of memory
</span>
</p>

<p>
We see that we possess this lower kind of memory
ourselves&mdash;that its process is the same in man and
dog and squirrel.  I am, for instance, riding or
walking in a part of the country which all seems
unfamiliar, and I have no recollection of ever having
passed that way before; but by-and-by I come to
some spot where I have had some little adventure,
some mishap, tearing my coat or wounding my hand
in getting through a barbed-wire fence; or where
I had discovered that I had lost something, or left
something behind at the inn where I last stayed;
or where I had a puncture in my tyre; or where I
first saw a rare and beautiful butterfly, or bird, or
flower, if I am interested in such things; and the
whole scene&mdash;the fields and trees and hedges, and
farm-house or cottage below&mdash;is all as familiar as
possible.  But it is the scene that brings back the
event.  The scene was impressed on the mind at
the emotional moment, and is instantly recognised,
and at the moment of recognition the associated
event is remembered.

<p>
The successive Junes, Julys, and Augusts
spent in this low-lying, warm forest country
have served to restore in my mind the insect
world to its proper place in the scheme of things.  In
recent years, in this northern land, it had not seemed
so important a place as at an earlier period of my
life in a country nearer to the sun.  Our insects, less
numerous, smaller in size, more modest in colouring,
and but rarely seen in swarms and clouds and
devastating multitudes, do not force themselves on our
attention, as is the case in many other regions of
the earth.  Here, for instance, where I am writing
this chapter, there is a stretch of flat, green, common
land by the Test, and on this clouded afternoon, at
the end of summer, while sitting on one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
innumerable little green hillocks covering the common,
it seemed to me that I was in a vacant place where
animal life had ceased to be.  Not an insect hummed
in that quiet, still atmosphere, not could I see one
tiny form on the close-cropped turf at my feet.  Yet
I was sitting on one of their populous habitations.
Cutting out a section of the cushion-like turf of
grass and creeping thyme that covered the hill and
made it fragrant, I found the loose, dry earth within
teeming with minute yellow ants, and many of the
hillocks around were occupied by thousands upon
thousands of the same species.  Indeed, I calculated
that in a hundred square yards at that spot the ant
inhabitants alone numbered not less than about two
hundred thousand.

It is partly on account of this smallness and
secretiveness of most of our insects&mdash;of our seeing so
little of insect life generally except during the summer
heats in a few favourable localities&mdash;and partly an
effect of our indoor life, that we think and care so
little about them.  The important part they play,
if it is taught us, fades out of knowledge: we grow in
time to regard them as one of the superfluities in
which nature abounds despite the ancient saying to
the contrary.  Or worse, as nothing but pests.  What
good are they to us indeed!  Very little.  The
silk-worm and the honey-bee have been in a measure
domesticated, and rank with, though a long way
after, our cattle, our animal pets and poultry.  But
wild insects!  There is the turnip-fly, and the
Hessian-fly, and botfly, and all sorts of worrying, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
blood-sucking, and disease-carrying flies, in and out
of houses; and gnats and midges, and fleas in seaside
lodgings, and wasps, and beetles, such as the cockchafer
and blackbeetle&mdash;are not all these pests?  This
is the indoor mind&mdash;its view of external nature&mdash;which
makes the society of indoor people unutterably
irksome to me, unless (it will be understood)
when I meet them in a house, in a town, where they
exist in some sort of harmony, however imperfect,
with their artificial environment.

<span class="sidenote">
Insects in visible nature
</span>
</p>

<p>
I am not concerned now with the question of the
place which insects occupy in the scale of being and
their part in the natural economy, but solely with
their effect on the nature-lover with or without the
"curious mind"&mdash;in fact, with insects as part of
this visible and audible world.  Without them, this
innumerable company that, each "deep in his day's
employ," are ever moving swiftly or slowly about
me, their multitudinous small voices united into one
deep continuous Æolian sound, it would indeed seem
as if some mysterious malady or sadness had come
upon nature.  Rather would I feel them alive, teasing,
stinging, and biting me; rather would I walk in all
green and flowery places with a cloud of gnats and
midges ever about me.  Nor do I wish to write
now about insect life generally: my sole aim in this
chapter is to bring before the reader some of the
most notable species seen in this place&mdash;those which
excel in size or beauty, or which for some other
reason are specially attractive.  For not only is this
corner of Hampshire most abounding in insect life,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
but here, with a few exceptions, the kings and nobles
of the tribe may be met with.
</p>

<p>
Merely to see these nobler insects as one may see
them here, as objects in the scene, and shining
gems in nature's embroidery, is a delight.  And
here it may be remarked that the company of the
entomologist is often quite as distasteful to me
out of doors as that of the indoor-minded person
who knows nothing about insects except that they
are a "nuisance."  Entomologist generally means
collector, and his&mdash;the entomologist's&mdash;admiration
has suffered inevitable decay, or rather has been
starved by the growth of a more vigorous plant&mdash;the
desire to possess, and pleasure in the possession
of, dead insect cases.

<span class="sidenote">
The parson lepidopterist
</span>
</p>

<p>
One summer afternoon I was visiting at the
parsonage in a small New Forest village in this low
district when my host introduced me to a friend of
his the vicar of a neighbouring parish, remarking
when he did so that I would be delighted to know
him as he was a great naturalist.  The gentleman
smiled, and said he was not a "great naturalist,"
but only a "lepidopterist."  Now it happened that
just then I had a lovely picture in my mind, the
vivid image of a humming-bird hawk-moth seen
suspended on his misty wings among the tall flowers in
the brilliant August sunshine.  I had looked on it
but a little while ago, and thought it one of the
most beautiful things in nature; naturally on meeting
a lepidopterist I told him what I had seen, and
something of the feeling the sight had inspired in me.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
smiled again, and remarked that the season had not
proved a very good one for the <i>Macroglossa stellatarum</i>.
He had, so far, seen only three specimens;
the first two he had easily secured, as he fortunately
had his butterfly net when he saw them.  But the
third!&mdash;he hadn't his net then; he was visiting one
of his old women, and was sitting in her garden
behind the cottage talking to her when the moth
suddenly made its appearance, and began sucking
at the flowers within a yard of his chair.  He knew
that in a few moments it would be gone for ever,
but fortunately from long practice, and a natural
quickness and dexterity, he could take any insect
that came within reach of his hand, however wild and
swift it might be.  "So!"&mdash;the parson lepidopterist
explained, suddenly dashing out his arm, then slowly
opening his closed hand to exhibit the imaginary
insect he had captured.  Well, he got the moth after
all!  And thus owing to his quickness and dexterity
all three specimens had been secured.
</p>

<p>
I, being no entomologist but only a simple person
whose interest and pleasure in insect life the entomologist
would regard as quite purposeless&mdash;I felt like a
little boy who had been sharply rebuked or boxed
on the ear.  This same lepidopterist may be dead
now, although a couple of summers ago he looked
remarkably well and in the prime of life; but I see
that someone else is now parson of his parish.  I
have not taken the pains to inquire; but, dead or
alive, I cannot imagine him, in that beautiful country
of the Future which he perhaps spoke about to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
old cottage woman&mdash;I cannot imagine him in white
raiment, with a golden harp in his hand; for if here,
in this country, he could see nothing in a hummingbird
hawk-moth among the flowers in the sunshine
but an object to be collected, what in the name of
wonder will he have to harp about!
</p>

<p>
The humming-bird hawk, owing to its diurnal
habits, may be seen by anyone at its best; but as
to the other species that equal and surpass it in
lustre, their beauty, so far as man is concerned, is
all wasted on the evening gloom.  They appear
suddenly, are vaguely seen for a few moments, then
vanish; and instead of the clear-cut, beautiful form,
the rich and delicate colouring and airy, graceful
motions, there is only a dim image of a moving grey
or brown something which has passed before us.
And some of the very best are not to be seen even as
vague shapes and as shadows.  What an experience it
would be to look on the death's-head moth in a state
of nature, feeding among the flowers in the early
evening, with some sunlight to show the delicate
grey-blue markings and mottlings of the upper- and
the indescribable yellow of the under-wings&mdash;is there
in all nature so soft and lovely a hue?  Even to see it
alive in the only way we are able to do, confined in
a box in which we have hatched it from a chrysalis
dug up in the potato patch and bought for sixpence
from a workman, to look on it so and then at its
portrait&mdash;for artists and illustrators have been trying
to do it these hundred years&mdash;is almost enough to
make one hate their art.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
</p>

<p>
My ambition has been to find this moth free, in
order to discover, if possible, whether or no it ever
makes its mysterious squeaking sound when at
liberty.  But I have not yet found it, and lepidopterists
I have talked to on this subject, some of whom
have spent their lives in districts where the insect is
not uncommon, have assured me that they have never
seen, and never expect to see, a death's-head which
has not been artificially reared.  Yet moths there
must be, else there would be no caterpillars and
no chrysalids.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Moths and butterflies
</span>
</p>

<p>
One evening, in a potato-patch, I witnessed a large
hawk-moth meet his end in a way that greatly
surprised me.  I was watching and listening to the
shrilling of a great green grasshopper, or leaf cricket,
that delightful insect about which I shall have to
write at some length in another chapter, when the
big moth suddenly appeared at a distance of a dozen
yards from where I stood.  It was about the size of
a privet-moth, and had not been many moments
suspended before a spray of flowers, when a meadow-pipit,
which had come there probably to roost, dashed
at and struck it down, and then on the ground began
a curious struggle.  The great moth, looking more
than half as big as the aggressor, beat the pipit with
his strong wings in his efforts to free himself; but
the other had clutched the soft, stout body in its
claws, and standing over it with wings half open and
head feathers raised, struck repeatedly at it with the
greatest fury until it was killed.  Then, in the same
savage hawk-like manner, the dead thing was torn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
up, the pipit swallowing pieces so much too large
for it that it had the greatest trouble to get them
down.  The gentle, timid, little bird had for the
moment put on the "rage of the vulture."
</p>

<p>
In the southern half of the New Forest, that part
of the country where insects of all kinds most abound,
the moths and butterflies are relatively less important
as a feature of the place, and as things of beauty, than
some other kinds.  The purple emperor is very rarely
seen, but the silver-washed fritillary, a handsome,
conspicuous insect, is quite common, and when several
of these butterflies are seen at one spot playing about
the bracken in some open sunlit space in the oak
woods, opening their orange-red spotty wings on the
broad, vivid green fronds, they produce a strikingly
beautiful effect.  It is like a mosaic of minute green
tesseræ adorned with red and black butterfly shapes,
irregularly placed.
</p>

<p>
But here the most charming butterfly to my mind
is the white admiral, when they are seen in numbers,
as in the abundant season of 1901, when the oak
woods were full of them.  Here is a species which,
seen in a collection, is of no more value æsthetically
than a dead leaf or a frayed feather dropped in the
poultry-yard, or an old postage stamp in an album,
without a touch of brilliance on its dull blackish-brown
and white wings; yet which alive pleases the
eye more than the splendid and larger kinds solely
because of its peculiarly graceful flight.  It never
flutters, and as it sweeps airily hither and thither,
now high as the tree-tops, now close to the earth in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
the sunny glades and open brambly places in the
oak woods, with an occasional stroke of the
swift-gliding wings, it gives you the idea of a smaller,
swifter, more graceful swallow, and sometimes of a
curiously-marked, pretty dragon-fly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dragon-flies
</span>
</p>

<p>
When we think of the bright colours of insects, the
dragon-flies usually come next to butterflies in the
mind, and here in the warmer, well-watered parts of
the Forest they are in great force.  The noble <i>Anax
imperator</i> is not uncommon; but though so great,
exceeding all other species in size, and so splendid
in his "clear plates of sapphire mail," with great
blue eyes, he is surpassed in beauty by a much
smaller kind, the <i>Libellula virgo alts erectis coloratis</i>
of Linnæus, now called <i>Calopteryx virgo</i>.  And just
as the great <i>imperator</i> is exceeded in beauty by the
small <i>virgo</i>, so is he surpassed in that other chief
characteristic of all dragon-flies to the unscientific
or natural mind, their uncanniness, by another quite
common species, a very little less than the <i>imperator</i>
in size&mdash;the <i>Cordulegaster annulatus</i>.
</p>

<p>
These names are a burden, and a few words must
be said on this point lest the reader should imagine
that he has cause to be offended with me personally.
</p>

<p>
Is it not amazing that these familiar, large, showy,
and striking-looking insects have no common specific
names with us?  The one exception known to me is
the small beautiful <i>virgo</i> just spoken of, and this is
called in books "Demoiselle" and "King George,"
but whether these names are used by the people
anywhere or not, I am unable to say.  On this point
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
I consulted an old water-keeper of my acquaintance
on the Test.  He has been keeper for a period of
forty-six years, and he is supposed to be very
intelligent, and to know everything about the creatures
that exist in those waters and water-meadows.  He
assured me that he never heard the names of Demoiselle
and King George.  "We calls them dragons and
horse-stingers," he said.  "And they do sting, and no
mistake, both horse and man."  He then explained that
the dragon-fly dashes at its victim, inflicts its sting, and
is gone so swiftly that it is never detected in the act;
but the pain is there, and sometimes blood is drawn.
</p>

<p>
Nor had the ancient water-keeper ever heard
another vernacular name given by Moses Harris
for this same species&mdash;kingfisher, to wit.  Moses
Harris, one of our earliest entomologists, wrote
during the last half of the eighteenth century, but
the date of his birth and the facts of his life are not
known.  He began to publish in 1766, his first work
being on butterflies and moths.  One wonders if
the unforgotten and at-no-time-neglected Gilbert
White never heard of his contemporary Moses, and
never saw his beautiful illustrations of British insects,
many of which still keep their bright colours and
delicate shadings undimmed by time in his old
folios.  In one of his later works, <i>An Exposition of
English Insects</i>, dated 1782, he describes and figures
some of our dragon-flies.  It was the custom of this
author to give the vernacular as well as the scientific
names to his species, and in describing the virgo
he says: "These ... on account of the brilliancy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
and richness of the colouring are called kingfishers."  But
he had no common name for the others, which
seemed to trouble him, and at last in desperation
after describing a certain species, he says that it is
"vulgarly called the dragon-fly"!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Vernacular names
</span>
</p>

<p>
I pity old Moses and I pity myself.  Why should
we have so many suitable and often pretty names
for moths and butterflies, mostly small obscure
creatures, and none for the well-marked, singular-looking,
splendid dragon-flies?  The reason is not far
to seek.  When men in search of a hobby to occupy
their leisure time look to find it in some natural
history subject, as others find it in postage stamps
and a thousand other things, they are, like children,
first attracted by those brilliant hues which they see
in butterflies.  Moreover, these insects when
preserved keep their colours, unlike dragon-flies and
some others, and look prettiest when arranged with
wings spread out in glass cases.  Moths being of the
same order are included, and so we get the collector
of moths and butterflies and the lepidopterist.  So
exceedingly popular is this pursuit, and the little
creatures collected so much talked and written about,
that it has been found convenient to invent English
names for them, and thus we have, in moths,
wood-tiger, leopard, goat, gipsy, ermine, wood-swift,
vapourer, drinker, tippet, lappet, puss, Kentish
glory, emperor, frosted green, satin carpet, coronet,
marbled beauty, rustic wing and rustic shoulder-knot,
golden ear, purple cloud, and numberless
others.  In fact, one could not capture the obscurest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
little miller that flutters round a reading-lamp which
the lepidopterist would not be able to find a pretty
name for.
</p>

<p>
The dragon-flies, being no man's hobby, are known
only by the old generic English names of dragons,
horse-stingers, adder-stingers, and devil's
darning-needles.  Adder-stinger is one of the commonest
names in the New Forest, but it is often simply
"adder."  One day while walking with a friend on
a common near Headley, we asked some boys if there
were any adders there.  "Oh yes," answered a little
fellow, "you will see them by the stream flying up
and down over the water."  The name does not mean
that dragon-flies sting adders, but that, like adders,
they are venomous creatures.  This very common and
wide-spread notion of the insect's evil disposition and
injuriousness is due to its shape and appearance&mdash;the
great fixed eyes, bright and sinister, and the long,
snake-like, plated or scaly body which, when the
insect is seized, curls round in such a threatening
manner.  The colouring, too, may have contributed
towards the evil reputation; at all events, one of our
largest species had a remarkably serpent-like aspect
due to its colour scheme&mdash;shining jet-black, banded
and slashed with wasp-yellow.  This is the magnificent
<i>Cordulegaster annulatus</i>, little inferior to the
<i>Anax imperator</i> in size, and a very common species
in the southern part of the New Forest in July.  But
how astonishing and almost incredible that this
singular-looking, splendid, most dragon-like of the
dragon-flies should have no English name!

Calopteryx virgo
</span>
</p>

<p>
Something remains to be said of the one dragon-fly
which has got a name, or names, although these
do not appear to be known to the country people.
Mr. W. T. Lucas, in his useful monograph on the
British dragon-flies, writes enthusiastically of this
species, <i>Calopteryx virgo</i>, that it is "the most resplendent
of our dragon-flies, if not of all British insects."  It
is too great praise; nevertheless the <i>virgo</i> is very
beautiful and curious, the entire insect, wings
included, being of an intense deep metallic blue, which
glistens as if the insect had been newly dipped in
its colour-bath.  Unlike other dragon-flies, it flutters
on the wing like a butterfly with a weak, uncertain
flight, and, again like a butterfly, holds its blue wings
erect when at rest.  It is one of the commonest as
well as the most conspicuous dragon-flies on the
Boldre, the Dark Water, and other slow and marshy
streams in the southern part of the Forest.
</p>

<p>
In South America I was accustomed to see dragon-flies
in rushing hordes and clouds, and in masses
clinging like swarming bees to the trees; here we
see them as single insects, but I once witnessed a
beautiful effect produced by a large number of the
common turquoise-blue dragon-fly gathered at one
spot, and this was in Hampshire.  I was walking, and
after passing a night at a hamlet called Buckhorn
Oak, in Alice Holt Forest, I went next morning, on
a Sunday, to the nearest church at the small village
of Rutledge.  It was a very bright windy morning in
June, and the oak woods had been stripped of their
young foliage by myriads of caterpillars, so that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
the sunlight fell untempered through the seemingly
dead trees on the bracken that covered the ground
below.  Now, at one spot over an area of about half
an acre, the bracken was covered with the common
turquoise-blue dragon-fly, clinging to the fronds,
their heads to the wind, their long bodies all pointing
the same way.  They were nowhere close together,
but very evenly distributed, about three to six inches
apart, and the sight of the numberless slips of
gem-like blue sprinkled over the billowy, vivid green fern
was a rare and exceedingly lovely one.
</p>

<p>
After writing of the lovely haunters of the twilight,
and that noblest one of all&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The great goblin moth who bears<br />
  Between his wings the ruined eyes of death,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and the angel butterfly, and the uncanny dragon-flies&mdash;the
flying serpents in their splendour&mdash;it may
seem a great descent to speak of such a thing as a
glow-worm, that poor grub-like, wingless, dull-coloured
crawler on the ground, as little attractive
to the eye as the centipede, or earwig, or the
wood-louse which it resembles.  Nor is the glow-worm a
southern species, since it is no more abundant in
the warmest district of Hampshire than in many
other parts of the country.  Nevertheless, when
treating of the Insect Notables of these parts, this
species which we call a "worm" cannot be omitted,
since it produces a loveliness surpassing that of all
other kinds.
</p>

<p>
Here it may be remarked that all the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
beautiful living things, from insect to man, like all the
highest productions of human genius, produce in us
a sense of the supernatural.  If any reader should say
in his heart that I am wrong, that it is not so, that
he experiences no such feeling, I can but remind
him that not all men possess all human senses and
faculties.  Some of us&mdash;many of us&mdash;lack this or that
sense which others have.  I have even met a man who
was without the sense of humour.  In the case of our
"worm," unbeautiful in itself, yet the begetter of so
great a beauty, the sense of something outside of
nature which shines on us through nature, even as
the sun shines in the stained glass of a church window,
is more distinctly felt than in the case of any other
insect in our country, because of the rarity of such a
phenomenon.  It is, with us, unique; but many of
us know the winged luminous insects of other lands.
Both are beautiful, both mysterious&mdash;the winged and
the wingless; but one light differs from another in
glory even as the stars.  The fire-fly is more splendid,
more surprising, in its flashes.  It flashes and is dark,
and we watch, staring at the black darkness, for the
succeeding flash.  It is like watching for rockets to
explode in the dark sky: there is an element of
impatience which interferes with the pleasure.  To
admire and have a perfect satisfaction, the insects
must be in numbers, in multitudes, sparkling
everywhere in the darkness, so that no regard is paid
to any individual light, but they are seen as we
see snowflakes.

Glow-worm and firefly
</span>
</p>

<p>
I fancy that Dante, in describing the appearance of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
glorified souls in heaven, unless he took it all from
Ezekiel, had the fire-fly in his mind:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bosom<br />
  Of that effulgence quivers a sharp flash,<br />
  Sudden and frequent in the guise of lightning.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of all who have attempted to describe and
compare the two insects&mdash;fire-fly and glow-worm&mdash;Thomas
Lovell Beddoes is the best.  Beddoes himself,
in those sudden brilliant letters to his friend
Kelsall, of Fareham, in this county, was a sort of
human fire-fly.  In a letter to Procter, from Milan,
1824, he wrote:
</p>

<p class="quote">
And what else have I seen?  A beautiful and far-famed insect&mdash;do
not mistake, I mean neither the Emperor, nor the King of
Sardinia, but a much finer specimen&mdash;the fire-fly.  Their bright
light is evanescent, and alternates with the darkness, as if the
swift whirling of the earth struck fire out of the black atmosphere;
as if the winds were being set upon that planetary grindstone, and
gave out such momentary sparks from their edges.  Their silence
is more striking than their flashes, for sudden phenomena are
almost invariably attended with some noise, but these little
jewels dart along the dark as softly as butterflies.  For their
light, it is not nearly so beautiful and poetical as our still
companion of the dew, the glow-worm, with his drop of moonlight.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I agree with Beddoes, but his pretty description
of our insect is not quite accurate, as I saw this
evening, when, after copious rain, the sky cleared
and a full moon shone on a wet, dusky-green earth.
The light of the suspended glow-worm was of an
exquisite golden green, and, side by side with it, the
moonlight on the wet surface of a polished leaf was
shining silver-white.
</p>

<p>
The light varies greatly in power, according, I
suppose, to the degree of excitement of the insect
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
and to the atmospheric conditions.  Occasionally you
will discover a light at a distance shining with a
strange glory, a light which might be mistaken for a
will-o'-the-wisp, and on a close view you will probably
find that a male is on the scene, and the female,
aware of his presence though he may be at some
distance from her, invisible in the darkness, has been
wrought up to the highest state of excitement.  You
will find her clinging to a stem or leaf, her luminous
part raised, and her whole body swaying in a measured
way from side to side.  If the insect happens to be a
foot or two above the ground, in a tangle of bramble
and bracken, with other plants with slender stems
and deep-cut leaves, the appearance is singularly
beautiful.  The light looks as if enclosed within an
invisible globe, which may be as much as fifteen
inches in diameter, and within its circle the minutest
details of the scene are clear to the vision, even to
the finest veining of the leaves, the leaves shining
a pure translucent green, while outside the mystic
globe of light all is in deep shadow and in blackness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The glow-worm's light
</span>
</p>

<p>
With regard to the attitude of the glow-worm when
displaying its light, we see how ignorant of the living
creature the illustrators of natural history books
have been.  In scores of works on our shelves, dating
from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, the
glow-worm is depicted giving out its light while
crawling on the ground, and in many illustrations
the male is introduced, and is shown flying down to
its mate.  They drew their figures not from life, but
from specimens in a cabinet, only leaving out the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
pins.  But the glow-worm is not perhaps a very
well-known creature.  A lady in Hampshire recently
asked me if it was a species of mole that came out
of its run to exhibit its light in the darkness.  The
insect invariably climbs up, and suspends itself by
clinging to, a stem or blade or leaf, and the hinder
part of the body curls up until its under surface, the
luminous part, is uppermost, thus making the light
visible from the air above.  In thick hedges I often
find the light four or even five feet above the ground.
Occasionally a glow-worm will shine from a flat
surface, usually a big leaf on to which it has crawled
when climbing.  Resting horizontally on the leaf,
it curls its abdomen up and over its body after
the manner of the earwig, until the light is in
the right position.
</p>

<p>
When we consider these facts&mdash;the way in which
the body is curved and twisted about in order (as
it seems) to exhibit the light to an insect flying
through the air above, and the increase in the light
when the sexual excitement is at its greatest&mdash;the
conclusion seems unavoidable that the light has
an important use, namely, to attract the male.
Unavoidable, I say, and yet I am not wholly convinced.
The fire-flies of diurnal habits may be seen
flying about, feeding and pairing, by day; yet when
evening comes they fly abroad again, exhibiting
their light.  What the function of the light is, or of
what advantage it is to the insect, we do not know.
Again, it has seemed to me that the male of the
glow-worm, even when attracted to the female, fears the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
light.  Thus, when the excitement of the shining
glow-worm has caused me to look for the male,
I have found him, not indeed in but outside of the
circle of light, keeping close to its borders, moving
about on feet and wings in the dark herbage and on
the ground.  I know very well that not a few
observations made by one person, but many&mdash;hundreds
if possible&mdash;by different observers, are needed before
we can say positively that the male glow-worm fears
or is repelled by the light.  But some of my observations
make me think that the male of the glow-worm,
like the males of many other species in different
orders that fly by night, is drawn to the female by
the scent, and that the light is a hindrance instead
of a help, although in the end he is drawn into it.
We always find it exceedingly hard to believe that
anything in nature is without a use; but we need
not go very far&mdash;not farther than our own bodies,
to say nothing of our minds&mdash;before we are compelled
to believe that it is so.  We may yet find that the
beautiful light of our still companion of the dew is
of no more use to it than the precious jewel in the
toad's head is to the toad.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hornets
</span>
</p>

<p>
The hornet, one of my first favourites, has, to our
minds, nothing mysterious like our glow-worm, and
nothing serpentine or supernatural about him, but he
is a nobler, more powerful and splendid creature
than any dragon-fly.  I care not to look at a vulgar
wasp nor at any diurnal insect, however fine, when he
is by, or his loud, formidable buzzing hum is heard.
As he comes out of the oak-tree shade and goes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
swinging by in his shining golden-red armature, he
is like a being from some other hotter, richer land,
thousands of miles away from our cold, white cliffs
and grey seas.  Speaking of that, our hornet, which
is at the head of the family and genus of true wasps
in Britain and Europe, is not only large and splendid
for a northern insect, since he is not surpassed in
lustre by any of his representatives in other parts
of the globe.
</p>

<p>
I admire and greatly respect him, this last feeling
dating back to my experience of wasps during my
early life in South America.  When a boy I was one
summer day in the dining-room at home by myself,
when in at the open door flew a grand wasp of a kind
I had never seen before, in size and form like the
hornet, but its colour was a uniform cornelian red
without any yellow.  Round the room it flew with a
great noise, then dashed against a window-pane, and
I, greatly excited and fearing it would be quickly
gone if not quickly caught, flew to the window, and
dashing out my hand, like the wonderfully clever
parson-collector, I grasped it firmly by the back
with finger and thumb.  Now, I had been accustomed
to seize wasps and bees of many kinds in this way
without getting stung, but this stranger was not like
other wasps, and quickly succeeded in curling his
abdomen round, and planting his long sting in the
sensitive tip of my forefinger.  Never in all my
experience of stings had I suffered such pain!  I dropped
my wasp like the hottest of coals, and saw him fling
himself triumphantly out of the room, and never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
again beheld one of his kind.  Even now when I
stand and watch English hornets at work on their
nests, coming and going, paying no attention to me,
a memory of that hornet of a distant land returns to
my mind; and it is like a twinge, and I venture on
no liberties with <i>Vespa crabro</i>.
</p>

<p>
The hornet is certainly not an abundant insect,
nor very generally distributed.  One may spend years
in some parts of the country and never see it.  I was
lately asked by friends in Kent, who have their
lonely house in a wooded and perhaps the wildest
spot in the county, if the hornet still existed in
England, or really was an English insect, as they had
not seen one in several years.  Now in the woods I
frequent in the Forest I see them every day, and the
abundance of the hornet is indeed for me one of the
attractions of the place.  His nests are rarely found
in old trees, but are common about habitations, in
wood-piles, and old, little-used outhouses.  I have
heard farmers say in this place that they would
not hurt a hornet, but regard it as a blessing.  So
it is, and so is every insect that helps to keep
down the everlasting plague of cattle-worrying and
crop-destroying flies and grubs and caterpillars.
</p>

<p>
But I am speaking of the hornet merely as an
Insect Notable, a spot of brilliant colour in the scene,
one of the shining beings that inhabit these green
mansions.  He is magnificent, and it is perhaps partly
due to his vivid and lustrous red and gold colour, his
noisy flight, and fierce hostile attitudes, and partly
to the knowledge of his angry spirit and venomous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
sting, which makes him look twice as big as he
really is.
</p>

<p>
One of the most impressive sights in insect life is,
strange to say, in the autumn, when cold rains and
winds and early frosts have already brought to an end
all that seemed best and brightest in that fairy world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Insects on ivy blossoms
</span>
</p>

<p>
This is where an ancient or large ivy grows in
some well-sheltered spot on a wall or church, or on
large old trees in a wood, and flowers profusely, and
when on a warm bright day in late September or in
October all the insects which were not wholly dead
revive for a season, and are drawn by the ivy's
sweetness from all around to that one spot.  There are
the late butterflies, and wasps and bees of all kinds,
and flies of all sizes and colours&mdash;green and
steel-blue, and grey and black and mottled, in thousands
and tens of thousands.  They are massed on the
clustered blossoms, struggling for a place; the air
all about the ivy is swarming with them, flying
hither and thither, and the humming sound they
produce may be heard fifty yards away like a high
wind.  One cannot help a feeling of melancholy at
this animated scene; but they are anything but
melancholy.  Their life has been a short and a merry
one, and now that it is about to end for ever they
will end it merrily, in feasting and revelry.
</p>

<p>
And never does the hornet look greater, the king
and tyrant of its kind, than on these occasions.  It
swings down among them with a sound that may be
heard loud and distinct above the universal hum,
and settles on the flowers, but capriciously, staying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
but a moment or two in one place, then moving to
another, the meaner insects all expeditiously making
room for it.  And after tasting a few flowers here and
there it takes its departure.  These large-sized
October hornets are all females, wanderers from ruined
homes, in search of sheltered places where, foodless
and companionless, and in a semi-torpid condition,
each may live through the four dreary months to
come.  In March the winter of their discontent will
be over, and they will come forth with the primrose
and sweet violet to be founders and mothers of new
colonies&mdash;the brave and splendid hornets of another
year; builders, fighters, and foragers in the green
oak-woods; a strenuous, hungry and thirsty people,
honey-drinkers, and devourers of the flesh of naked
white grubs, and caterpillars, black and brown and
green and gold, and barred and quaintly-coloured
swift aerial flies.

CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Great and greatest among insects&mdash;Our feeling for insect

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I had thought to include all or most of the
greatest of the insects known in these parts in
the last chapter, but the hornet, and the vision
it called up of that last revel in the late-blossoming
ivy on the eve of winter and cold death, seemed to
bring that part of the book to an end.  The hornet
was the greatest in the sense that a strong man and
conqueror is the greatest among ourselves, as the
lion or wolf among mammals, and that feathered
thunderbolt and scourge, the peregrine falcon, among
birds.  But there are great and greatest in other
senses; and just as there are singers, big and little,
as well as warriors among the "insect tribes of human
kind," so there are among these smaller men of the
mandibulate division of the class Insecta.  And their
singers, when not too loud and persistent, as they
are apt to be in warmer lands than ours, are among
the most agreeable of the inhabitants of the earth.
They are less to us than to the people of the southern
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
countries of Europe&mdash;infinitely less than they were
to some of the civilised nations of antiquity, and
than they are to the Japanese of to-day.  This is,
I suppose, on account of their rarity with us, for
our best singers are certainly somewhat rare or else
exceedingly local.  The field-cricket, which must be
passed over in this chapter to be described later on,
is an instance in point.  The universal house-cricket
is known to, and in some degree loved by, all or most
persons; it is the cricket on the hearth, that warm,
bright, social spot when the world outside is dark and
cheerless; the lively, companionable sound endears
itself to the child, and later in life is dear because of
its associations.  The field-grasshopper, too, is
familiar to everyone in the summer pastures; but the
best of our insect musicians, the great green
grasshopper, appears to be almost unknown to the people.
Here, for instance, where I am writing, there is one
on the table which stridulates each afternoon, and in
the evening when the lamp is lighted.  The sustained
bright shrilling penetrates to all parts of the house,
and in the tap-room of the inn, two rooms away, the
villagers, coming in for their evening beer and
conversation, are startled at the unfamiliar, sharp, silvery
sound, and ask if it is a bird.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Insect music
</span>
</p>

<p>
Probably it is owing to this rarity of our best
insect singers, and partly, too, perhaps to the
disagreeable effect on our ears of the loud cicadas heard
during our southern travels, that an idea is produced
in us of something exotic, or even fantastic, in a
taste for insect music.  We wonder at the ancient
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
Greeks and the modern Japanese.  But it should be
borne in mind that the sounds had and have for
them an expression they cannot have for us&mdash;the
expression which comes of association.
</p>

<p>
If the insects named as our best are rare and local,
or at all events not common, what shall we say of
our cicada?  Can we call him a singer at all? or if
he be not silent, as some think, will he ever be more
to us than a figure and descriptive passage in a
book&mdash;a mere cicada of the mind?  He is the most local,
or has the most limited range, of all, being seldom
found out of the New Forest district.  He was
discovered there about seventy years ago, and Curtis,
who gave him the proud name of <i>Cicada anglica</i>,
expressed the opinion that he had no song.  And
many others have thought so too, because they have
been unable to hear him.  Others, from Kirby and
Spence to our time, have been of a contrary opinion.
So the matter stands.  A. H. Swinton, in his work on
<i>Insect Variety and Propagation</i>, 1885, relates that he
tried in vain to hear <i>Cicada anglica</i> before going to
France and Italy to make a study of the cicada
music; and he writes:
</p>

<p class="quote">
In northern England their woodland melody has not yet fallen
on the ear of the entomologist, but it must not therefore be
inferred that these musicians are wholly absent, for among the rich
and bounteous southern fauna of Hampshire and Surrey we still
retain one outlying waif of the cigales ... <i>Cicada anglica</i>,
seemingly the <i>montana</i> of Scopoli, if not <i>Hamatodes in proprid
persona</i>.  The male, usually beaten in June from blossoming
hawthorn in the New Forest, is provided with instruments of
music, and the female, more terrestrial, is often observed
wandering with a whit-ring sound among bracken wastes, where she is
thought to deposit her ova.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
</p>

<p>
It struck me some time ago that some of the
disappointed entomologists may have heard the sound
they were listening for without knowing it.  In seeking
for an object&mdash;some rare little flower, let us say,
or a chipped flint, or a mushroom&mdash;we set out with
an image of it in the mind, and unless the object
sought for corresponds to its mental prototype, we
in many cases fail to recognise it, and pass on.  And
it is the same with sounds.  The listeners perhaps
heard a sound so unlike their idea, or image, of a
cicada's song, or so like the sound of some other
quite different insect, that they paid no attention to
it, and so missed what they sought for.  At all events,
I can say that unless we have some orthopterous
insect, of a species unknown to me, which sings in
trees, then our cicada does sing, and I have heard
it.  The sound which I heard, and which was new
to me, came from the upper foliage of a large thorn-tree
in the New Forest, but unfortunately it ceased
on my approach, and I failed to find the singer.  The
entomologist may say that the question remains as
it was, but my experience may encourage him to try
again.  Had I not been expecting to hear an insect
singing high up in the trees, I should have said at
once that this was a grasshopper's music, though
unlike that of any of the species I am accustomed
to hear.  It was a sustained sound, like that of the
great green grasshopper, but not of that excessively
bright, subtle, penetrative quality: it was a lower
sound, not shrill, and distinctly slower&mdash;in other
words, the beats or drops of sound which compose
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
the grasshopper's song, and run in a stream, were
more distinct and separate, giving it a trilling rather
than a reeling character.  Had we, in England,
possessed a stridulating mantis, which is capable
of a slower, softer sound than any grasshopper,
I should have concluded that I was listening to one;
but there was not, in this New Forest music, the
slightest resemblance to the cicada sounds I had
heard in former years.  The cicadas may be a "merry
people," and they certainly had the prettiest things
said of them by the poets of Greece, but I do not
like their brain-piercing, everlasting whirr; this sound
of the English cicada, assuming that I heard that
insect, was distinctly pleasing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Locusta viridissima
</span>
</p>

<p>
But more than cicada, or field-cricket, or any
other insect musician in the land, is our great green
grasshopper, or leaf-cricket, <i>Locusta viridissima</i>.  I
have been accustomed to hear him in July and
August, in hedges, gardens, and potato patches at
different points along the south coast and at some
inland spots, always in the evening.  It is easy, even
after dark, to find him by following up the sound,
when he may be seen moving excitedly about on
the topmost sprays or leaves, pausing at intervals
to stridulate, and occasionally taking short leaps
from spray to spray.  He belongs to a family widely
distributed on the earth, and in La Plata I was
familiar with two species which in form and colour&mdash;a
uniform vivid green&mdash;were just like our <i>viridissima</i>,
but differed in size, one being smaller and the other
twice as large.  The smaller species sang by day, all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
day long, among water-plants growing in the water;
the large species stridulated only by night, chiefly
in the maize fields, and was almost as loud and harsh
as the cicadas of the same region.  I distinctly
remember the sounds emitted by these two species, and by
several other grasshoppers and leaf-crickets, but none
of their sounds came very near in character to that
of <i>viridissima</i>.  This is a curious, and to my sense a
very beautiful sound; and when a writer describes
it as "harsh," which we not unfrequently find, I
must conclude either that one of us hears wrongly,
or not as the world hears, or that, owing to poverty,
he is unable to give a fit expression.  It is a sustained
sound, a current of brightest, finest, bell-like strokes
or beats, lasting from three or four to ten or fifteen
seconds, to be renewed again and again after short
intervals; but when the musician is greatly excited,
the pauses last only for a moment&mdash;about half a
second, and the strain may go on for ten minutes or
longer before a break of any length.  But the quality
is the chief thing; and here we find individual
differences, and that some have a lower, weaker
note, in which may be detected a buzz, or sibilation,
as in the field-grasshopper; but, as a rule, it is of a
shrillness and musicalness which is without parallel.
The squealings of bats, shrews, and young mice are
excessively sharp, and are aptly described as "needles
of sound," but they are not musical.  The only bird
I know which has a note comparable to the <i>viridissima</i>
is the lesser whitethroat&mdash;the excessively sharp,
bright sound emitted both as an anger-note and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
in that low and better song described in a former
chapter.  It is this musical sharpness which pleases
in the insect, and makes it so unlike all other sounds
in a world so full of sound.  Its incisiveness produces
a curious effect: sitting still and listening for some
time at a spot where several insects are stridulating,
certain nerves throb with the sound until it seems
that it is in the brain, and is like that disagreeable
condition called "ringing in the ears" made pleasant.
Almost too fine and sharp to be described as metallic,
perhaps it comes nearer to the familiar sound described
by Henley:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Of ice and glass the tinkle,<br />
  Pellucid, crystal-shrill.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Crystal beads dropped in a stream down a crystal
stair would produce a sound somewhat like the
insect's song, but duller.  We may, indeed, say that
this grasshopper's sounding instrument is glass; it
is a shining talc-like disc, which may be seen with
the unaided sight by raising the elytra.
</p>

<p>
Some time ago, in glancing through some copies
of Newman's monthly <i>Entomologist</i>, 1836, I came
upon an account of a numerous colony of the great
green grasshopper, which the writer found by chance
at a spot on the Cornish coast.  The effect produced
by the stridulating of a large number of these insects
was very curious.  I envied the old insect-hunter his
experience.  A colony of <i>viridissima</i>&mdash;what a happiness
it would be to discover such a thing!  And now,
late in the summer of 1902, I have found one, and
though a very thinly populated one compared to his,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
it has given me a long-coveted opportunity of watching
and listening to the little green people to my
heart's content.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Good-for-nothing grass
</span>
</p>

<p>
The happy spot was in Harewood Forest, a dense
oak-wood covering an area of about two thousand
acres, a few miles from Andover.  I had haunted it
for some days, finding little wild life to interest me
except the jays, which seemed to be the principal
inhabitants.  In the middle of this forest or wood,
among the oak trees there stands a tall handsome
granite cross about thirty feet high, placed to mark
the exact spot, known as "Deadman's Plack," where
over nine centuries ago King Edgar, with his own
hand, slew his friend and favourite, Earl Athelwold.
The account which history gives of this pious monarch,
called the Peaceable, despite his volcanic disposition
where women were concerned, especially his affair
with Elfrida, who was also pious and volcanic as well
as beautiful, reads in these dull, proper times like
a tale from another hotter, fiercer world.  It is not
strange that many persons find their way through
the thick forest by the narrow track to this place or
"Plack"; and there too I went on several days, and
sat by the hour and meditated.  It had struck me as
a suitable spot to watch for the purple emperor; but
I saw him not, and once only I caught sight of his
bride to be&mdash;a big black-looking butterfly which rose
from the top of an oak, took a short flight, and
returned to settle once more on the highest leaves in
the same place.  This vain hunt for the purple king
of the butterflies&mdash;to see him, not to "take"&mdash;led
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
to the discovery of the green minstrels.  Near the
cross, or "monument," as it is called, there is an
open place occupying a part of the top and a slope
of a down, as pretty a bit of wild heath as may be
found in the county.  Stony and barren in places, it
is in other parts clothed in ling, purple with bloom
at this season, with a few pretty little birches and
clumps of tangled thorn and bramble scattered
about.  But the feature which gives a peculiar charm
to the spot is the false brome grass which flourishes
on the slope, growing in large patches, and on the
borders of these mixing its vivid light-green tussocks
with the purple-flowered heath.  It is the species
called (in books) heath false brome grass, but as
lips of man refuse to pronounce these four ponderous
monosyllables, the invention of some dreary botanist,
that follow and jolt against each other, I will venture
to rename it good-for-nothing grass.  For it is useless
to the farmer, since no domestic herbivore will touch
it; its sole justification is its exceeding beauty.  It
grows as high as a man's knees, or higher, and even
in the driest, hottest season keeps its wonderfully
vivid fresh green, as near a brilliant colour as any
green leaf can be; and the stalks and graceful spikes
after the flowering time are pale yellow-brown, and
have a golden lustre in the bright August and
September sunlight.  Could our poetical <i>viridissima</i> have
a more suitable home!  And here, coming out from
the thick oaks and sauntering about the heath I
caught the sound of his delicate shrilling, and to my
delight found myself in the midst of a colony.  They
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
were not abundant, and one could not experience the
sensation produced by many stridulating at a time:
they were thinly scattered over two or three acres of
ground, but at some points I could hear several of
them shrilling together at different distances, and it
was not difficult to keep two or three in sight at
one time.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto I had known this insect as an evening
musician, beginning as a rule after sunset and
continuing till about eleven o'clock.  Here he made his
music only during the daylight hours, from about
ten or eleven in the morning until five or six o'clock
in the afternoon, becoming silent at noon when it
was hot.  But it was late in the season when I found
him, on 26th August, and after much rain the weather
had become exceptionally cool for the time of year.

RIVAL GREAT GREEN GRASSHOPPERS
</p>

<p>
When stridulating it appeared to be the ambition
of every male grasshopper to get up as high as he
could climb on the stiff blades and thin stalks of the
grass; and there, very conspicuous in his uniform
green colour which in a strong sunlight looked like
the green of verdigris, his translucent overwings
glistening like a dragon-fly's wings, he would shrill
and make the grass to which he was clinging tremble
to his rapidly vibrating body.  Then he would listen
to the shrill response of some other singer not far
off, and then sing and listen again, and yet again;
then all at once in a determined manner he would
set out to find his rival, travelling high up through
the grass, climbing stems and blades until they
bent enough for him to grasp others and push on,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
reminding one of a squirrel progressing through the
thin highest branches of a hazel copse.  After covering
the distance in this manner, with a few short pauses
by the way to shrill back an answering challenge, he
would find a suitable place near to the other, still
in his place high up in the grass; and then the two,
a foot or so, sometimes three or four inches, apart,
would begin a regular duel in sound at short range.
Each takes his turn, and when one sings the other
raises one of his forelegs to listen; one may say that
in lifting a leg he "cocks an ear."  The attitude of
the insects is admirably given in the accompanying
drawing from life.  This contest usually ends in a real
fight: one advances, and when at a distance of five or
six inches makes a leap at his adversary, and the other,
prepared for what is coming and in position, leaps too
at the same time, so that they meet midway, and
strike each other with their long spiny hind legs.
It is done so quickly that the movements cannot
be followed by the eye, but that they do hit hard is
plain, as in many cases one is knocked down or flung
to some distance away.  Thus ends the round; the
beaten one rushes off as quickly as he can, as if hurt,
but soon pulls up, and lowering his head, begins
defiantly stridulating as before.  The other follows
him up, shrills at and attacks him again; and you
may see a dozen or twenty such encounters between
the same two in the course of half an hour.
Occasionally when the blow is struck they grasp each
other and fall together; and it is hardly to be doubted
that they not only kick, like French wrestlers and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
bald-headed coots, but also make wicked use of their
powerful black teeth.  Some of the fighters I examined
had lost a portion of one of the forelegs&mdash;one had
lost portions of two&mdash;and these had evidently been
bitten off.  Perhaps they inflict even worse injuries.
Hearing two shrilling against each other at a spot
where there was a large clump of heath between
them, I dropped down close by to listen and watch,
when I discovered a third grasshopper sitting
mid-way between the others in the centre of the
heath-bush.  This one appeared more excited than the
others, keeping his wings violently agitated almost
without a pause, and yet not the faintest sound
proceeded from him.  It proved on examination that
one of his stiff overwings had been bitten or torn off
at the base, so that he had but half of his sounding
apparatus left, and no music could his most passionate
efforts ever draw from it, and, silent, he was
no more in the world of green grasshoppers than a
bird with a broken wing in the world of birds.

<span class="sidenote">
Singing-contests

</p>

<p>
For it cannot be doubted that his own music is
the greatest, the one all-absorbing motive and passion
of his little soul.  This may seem to be saying too
much&mdash;to attribute something of human feelings to a
creature so immeasurably far removed from us.
Fantastic in shape, even among beings invertebrate and
unhuman, one that indeed sees with opal eyes set
in his green goat-like mask, but who hears with his
forelegs, breathes through spiracles set in his sides,
whipping the air for other sense-impressions and
unimaginable sorts of knowledge with his excessively
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
long limber horns, or antennæ, just as a dry-fly fisher
whips the crystal stream for speckled trout; and,
finally, who wears his musical apparatus (his vocal
organs) like an electric shield or plaster on the small
of his back.  Nevertheless it is impossible to watch
their actions without regarding them as creatures
of like passions with ourselves.  The resemblance is
most striking when we think not of what we, hard
Saxons, are in this cold north, but of the more fiery,
music-loving races in warmer countries.  I remember
in my early years, before the advent of "Progress"
in those outlying realms, that the ancient singing
contests still flourished among the gauchos of La
Plata.  They were all lovers of their own peculiar
kind of music, singing endless <i>decimas</i> and <i>coplas</i> in
high-pitched nasal tones to the strum-strumming of
a guitar; and when any singer of a livelier mind
than his fellows had the faculty of improvising, his
fame went forth, and the others of his quality were
filled with emulation, and journeyed long distances
over the lonely plains to meet and sing against him.
How curiously is this like our island grasshoppers,
who have come to us unchanged from the past, and
are neither Saxons nor Celts, but true, original,
ancient Britons&mdash;the little grass-green people with
passionate souls!  You can almost hear him say&mdash;this
little green minstrel you have been watching
when his shrill note has brought back as shrill an
answer&mdash;as he resolutely sets out over the tall,
bending grasses in the direction of the sound,
"I'll teach him to sing!"

A human parallel
</span>
</p>

<p>
So interested was I in watching them, so delighted
to be in this society, whose members, for all their
shape, no longer moved about in, to me, unimaginable
worlds, that I went day after day and spent long
hours with them.  I could best watch their battles
by getting down on my knees in the good-for-nothing
("heath false brome") grass, so as to bring my eyes
within two or three feet of them.  My attitude,
kneeling with bowed head by the half-hour at a
stretch, one day attracted the attention of some
persons who had come in a carriage to picnic under
the trees at the foot of the slope, four or five hundred
yards away.  There were from time to time little
explosions of laughter, and at last a young lady of
twelve or fourteen cried, or piped out, in a clear,
far-reaching voice, "Holy man!"  She was an
impudent monkey.
</p>

<p>
So far not a word has been said of the female,
simply because, as it seemed to me, there was, so
far, nothing to say.  In most insects the odour
excites and draws the males, often from long
distances, as we see in the moths; they fly to, and
find, and see her, and woo, and chase, and fight with
each other for possession of her; and when there are
beautiful or fantastic movements, sometimes accompanied
with sounds, corresponding to the antics of
birds&mdash;I have observed them in species of Asilidæ
and other insects&mdash;they are directly caused by the
presence of the female.  But with <i>viridissima</i> it
appears not to be so, since they do not seek the
female, nor will they notice her when she comes in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
their way, but they are wholly absorbed in their
own music, and in trying to outsing the others, or,
failing in this, to kick and bite them into silence.
</p>

<p>
Now, seeing this strange condition of things among
these insects&mdash;seeing it day after day for weeks&mdash;the
conclusion forced itself upon my mind that we have
here one of those strange cases among the lower
creatures which are not uncommon in human life&mdash;the
case of a faculty, a means to an end, being developed
and refined to an excessive degree, and the
reflex effect of this too great refinement on the
species, or race.  Comparing it then to certain human
matters&mdash;to Art, let us say&mdash;we see that that which
was but a means has become an end, and is pursued
for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
Such a conclusion may seem absurd, and perhaps
it is, since we cannot know what "nimble emanations"
and vibrations, which touch not our coarser
natures, there may be to link these diverse and
seemingly ill-fitting actions into one perfect chain.
It may be said, for instance, that in this species the
incessant stridulating of the male has an action
similar to that of the sun's light and heat on plant
life, causing the flower to blow and its sexual organs
to ripen.  But we see, too, that Nature does often
overshoot her mark.  We have seen it, I think, in
the over-refinement of the passion and faculty of
fear in certain species, in reference to cases of
fascination, and we see it in the over-protected and the
over-specialised; but we are so imbued with the idea
that the right mean has always been hit upon and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
adhered to, that it is only in view of the most flagrant
cases to the contrary that we are ever startled out
of that delusion.  The miserable case, for example,
of the <i>Polyergus rufescens</i>, the slave-making ant, who,
from being too much waited upon, has so entirely
lost the power of waiting upon himself that he will
perish of hunger amidst plenty if his slaves be not
there to pick up and put the food into his mouth.
These extreme cases are not the only ones; for every
one of such a character there are hundreds of cases.
"Degeneration," as Ray Lankester has aptly said,
"goes hand in hand with elaboration"; and I would
add that in numberless cases over-elaboration is the
cause of degeneration.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The female viridissima
</span>
</p>

<p>
The female is the grander insect, being nearly a
third larger than the male, of a fuller figure, and
adorned with a long, broadsword-shaped ovipositor,
which projects beyond her wings like a tail.  She
has rather a grand air too, and is both silent and
inactive.  Hers is a life of listening and waiting;
and the waiting is long&mdash;days and weeks go by, and
the males stridulate, and fight, and pay no attention
to her.  But how patient she can be may be seen
in the case of one which I took from her heath and
placed on a well-berried branch of wild guelder on
my table.  There she was contented to rest, usually
on one of the topmost clusters, for many days,
almost always with the window open at the side of
her branch, so that she could easily have made her
escape.  The wind blew in upon her, and outside the
world was green and lit with sunshine.  One could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
almost fancy that she was conscious of her fine
appearance in her pale vivid green colour, touched
in certain lights with glaucous blue, on her throne
of clustered carbuncles.  At intervals of an hour or
two she would move about a little, and find some
other perch; only the waving of her long, fine
antennæ appeared to show that she was alive to
much that was going on about her&mdash;in her world.
The one thing that excited her was the stridulating
of one of the males confined in a glass vessel on
the same table.  She would then travel over her
branch to get as near as possible to the musician,
and would remain motionless, even to the nervous
antennæ, and apparently absorbed in the sound for
as long as it lasted.  At first she ate a few of the
crimson berries on her branch, and also took a little
parsley and shepherd's purse, but later on she
declined all green stuff, and fed on jam, honey,
cooked sultanas, and bread-and-butter pudding,
which she liked best.  Water and ginger-beer for
drink.  This most placid and dignified lady&mdash;we
had got into calling her "Lady Greensleeves," and
"Queen," and sometimes "The Cow"&mdash;was restored,
on 12th September, in good health, after sixteen days,
to her native heath, and disappeared from sight in
the long grass, quietly making her way to some spot
where she could settle down comfortably to listen to
the music.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Habits of female
</span>
</p>

<p>
All the females I found and watched behaved as
my captive had done.  They were no more active,
and preferred to be at a good height above the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
ground&mdash;eighteen inches or two feet&mdash;when quietly
listening.  One day I watched one perched on the
topmost spray of a heath-bush in her listening
attitude: clouds came over the sun, and the wind
grew colder and stronger, and the singers ceased
singing.  And at last, finding that the silence
continued, and doubtless feeling uncomfortable on that
spray where the wind blew on and swayed her about,
she slowly climbed down and settled herself in a
horizontal position on the sheltered side of the plant;
and when the sun broke out and shone on her she
tipped over on one side, stretched her hind legs out,
and rested motionless in that position, exactly like
a fowl lying in her dusting-place luxuriating in
the heat.
</p>

<p>
But at last, despite that air of repose which is her
chief characteristic, she is so wrought upon by that
perpetual, shrill, irresistible music that she can no
longer endure to sit still, but is drawn to it.  She
goes to her charmers, one may say, to remind them
by her presence that the minstrelsy in which they
are so absorbed is not itself an end but a means.
Brisk or lively she cannot be, but it is plain that when
she follows up or settles herself down near her
forgetful knights, she is greatly excited, and waiting
to be taken in marriage.  That she distinguishes one
singer above others, or exercises "selection" in the
Darwinian sense, seems unlikely: it strikes one, on
the contrary, that having so long suffered neglect
she is only too willing to be claimed by any one of
them.  And this is just what they decline to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
do&mdash;for some time, at any rate.  Again and again I have
observed when the female had followed and placed
herself close to a couple of these rival musicians,
that they took not the least notice of her; and that
when, in the course of the alarums and excursions,
one of them found himself close to her, the sight of
her appeared to disconcert him, and he made all
haste to get away from her.  It looked to human
eyes as if her large portly figure had not corresponded
to his ideal, and had even moved him to repugnance.
But the Ann of Cleves in a green gown is an exceedingly
patient person, and very persistent, and though
often denied, she will not be denied, or take No for
an answer.  But it is altogether a curious business,
for not only is the wooing process reversed, as many
think it is in the cuckoo, but it lasts an
unconscionable time in a creature whose life, in the
perfect stage, is limited to a season.  But the
female <i>viridissima</i> has not the power and swiftness
of that feathered lady who boldly pursues her singer
(in love with nothing but his own voice), and
compels him to take her.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the last chapter I got away&mdash;succeeded in
breaking away, would perhaps be a better
expression&mdash;from that favourite hunting-ground of
mine farther south; and the reader would perhaps
care to know why a book descriptive of days in
Hampshire should be so much taken up with days
in one small corner of the county.  Hampshire is not
a very large county compared with some others: I
have traversed it in this and in that direction often
enough to be pretty familiar with a great deal of it,
from the walled-round cornfield which was once
Roman Calleva to the Solent; and from the beautiful
wild Rother on the Sussex border to the Avon
in the west.  There is much to see and know within
these limits: for all those whose proper study is man,
his history and his works; and for the archæologist
and for the artist and seekers after the picturesque,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
there is much&mdash;nay, there is more to attract in the
northern than in the southern half of the county.
I, not of them, go south, and by preference to
one spot, because my chief interest and delight is
in life&mdash;life in all its forms, from man who "walks
erect and smiling looks on heaven" to the minutest
organic atoms&mdash;the invisible life.  It here comes
into my mind that the very smell of the earth, in
which we all delight, the smell which fills the air
after rain in summer, and is strong when we turn
up a spadeful of fresh mould, which the rustic calls
"good," believing, perhaps rightly, that we must
smell it every day to be well and live long, is after
all an odour given off by a living thing&mdash;<i>Cladothrix
odorifera</i>.  Too small for human eyes, which see only
objects proportioned to their bigness, so minute,
indeed, that millions may inhabit a clod no larger
than one's watch, yet they are able to find a passage
to us through the other subtler sense; and from the
beginning of our earthly journey even to its end we
walk with this odour in our nostrils, and love it, and
will perhaps take with us a sweet memory of it into
the after-life.
</p>

<p>
Life being more than all else to me, I am drawn
to the spot where it exists in greatest abundance
and variety.
</p>

<p>
I remember feeling this passion very strongly one
day during this summer of 1902 after looking at a
spider.  It was an interesting spider, and I found it
within a couple of miles of Lyndhurst, of all places;
a spot so disagreeable to me that I avoid it, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
look for nothing and wish for nothing to detain me
in its vicinity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lyndhurst
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lyndhurst is objectionable to me not only because
it is a vulgar suburb, a transcript of Chiswick or
Plumstead in the New Forest where it is in a wrong
atmosphere, but also because it is the spot on which
London vomits out its annual crowd of collectors,
who fill its numerous and ever-increasing brand-new
red-brick lodging-houses, and who swarm through
all the adjacent woods and heaths, men, women, and
children (hateful little prigs!) with their vasculums,
beer and treacle pots, green and blue butterfly nets,
killing bottles, and all the detestable paraphernalia
of what they would probably call "Nature Study."
</p>

<p>
It happened that one day, a mile or two from
Lyndhurst, going along the road I caught sight of
a pretty bit of heath through an opening in the
wood, and turning into it I looked out a spot to rest
in, and was just about to cast myself down when
I noticed a small white spider, disturbed by my
step, drop from a cluster of bell-heath flowers to
the ground.  I stood still, and presently the spider,
recovered from its alarm, drew itself up again by
an invisible thread and settled down on the
bright-coloured blossoms.  Seating myself close by, I began
to watch the strangely shaped and coloured little
creature.  It was a <i>Thomisus</i>&mdash;a genus of spiders
distinguished by the extraordinary length of the two
pairs of forelegs.  The one before me, <i>Thomisus
citreus</i>, is also singular on account of its colour&mdash;pale
citron or white&mdash;and its habit of sitting on flowers.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
This habit and the colour, we may see, are related.
The <i>citreus</i> is not a weaver of snares, but hunts for
its prey, or rather lies in wait to capture any insect
that comes to the flower on which it sits.  On white,
yellow, and indeed on most pale-coloured flowers,
it almost becomes invisible.  On the brilliant red
bell-heath blossom it showed plainly enough, but
even here it did not look nearly so conspicuous as
when on a green leaf.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wooing spider's antics
</span>
</p>

<p>
I had observed this white spider before, but had
always seen it sitting motionless in its flower; this
one was curiously restless, and very soon after I had
settled myself down by its side it began to throw
itself into a variety of strange attitudes.  The four
long forelegs would go up all at once and stand out
like rays from the round, white body, and by-and-by
they would drop and hang down like two long strings
from the flower.  Pretty soon I discovered the cause
of these actions in the presence of a second spider,
less than half the size of the first, moving about close
by.  His smallness and hideling habits had prevented
me from seeing him sooner.  This small, active, white
creature was the male, and though moving constantly
about in the heath at a distance of half a foot from
her, it was plain that they could see each other and
also understand each other very well.  As he moved
round her, passing by means of the threads he kept
throwing out from spray to spray, she moved round
on her flower to keep him in sight; but though
fascinated and drawn to her, he still dreaded, and was
pulled by his fear and his desire in opposite ways.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
The excitement of both would increase whenever he
came a little nearer, and their attitudes were then
sometimes very curious, the most singular being one
of the male when he would raise his body vertically
in the air and stand on his two pairs of forelegs.
When very near, they would extend the long forelegs
and touch one another; but always at this point
when they were closest and the excitement greatest
a panic would seize him, and he would make haste
to get to a safer distance.  On two such occasions
she, as if afraid to lose him altogether, quitted her
beloved flower and moved after him, and after
wandering about for some time to no purpose, found
another flower-cluster to settle on.  And so the queer
wooing went on, and seemed no nearer to a conclusion,
when, to my surprise, I found that I had been
sitting and lying there, with eyes close to the female
spider, for an hour and a half.  Once only, feeling a
little bored, I gently stroked her on the back, which
appeared to please her as much as if she had been a
pig and I had scratched her back with my walking-stick.
But no sooner had the soothing effect passed
off than she began again watching the movements of
that fantastic little lover of hers, who loved her for
her beautiful white body, but feared her on account
of those poison fangs which he could probably see
every time she smiled to encourage him.  At the
end of my long watch the conclusion of the whole
complex business seemed farther off than ever: fear
had got the mastery, and the male had put so
great a distance between them, and moved now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
so languidly, that it seemed useless to remain
any longer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A little forest boy
</span>
</p>

<p>
I had not been watching alone all this time: when
I had been about half an hour on the spot I had a
visitor, a small miserable-looking New Forest boy;
he came walking towards me with a little crooked
stick in his hand, and asked me in a low, husky
voice if I had seen a pony in that part of the Forest.
I told him sharply not to come too near as his steps
would disturb a spider I was watching.  It did not
seem to surprise him that I was there by myself
watching a spider, but creeping up he subsided
gently on the heath by my side and began watching
with me.  At intervals when there was a lull in the
excitement of the spiders I could spare time for a
glance at my poor little companion.  He was probably
eleven or twelve years old, but his stature was that
of a boy of eight&mdash;a small, stunted creature, meanly
dressed, with light-coloured lustreless hair, pale-blue
eyes, and a weary sad expression on his pale face.
Yet he called himself a gipsy!  But the south of
England gipsies are a mixed and degenerate lot.  They
are now so incessantly harried by the authorities
that the best of them settle down in the villages,
while those who keep to the old ways and vagrant
open-air life are joined by tramps and wastrels of
every shade of colour.  This little fellow had little or
no Romany blood in his watery veins.
</p>

<p>
He told me that his people were camping not far
off, and that the party consisted of his parents with
six (the half-dozen youngest) of their thirteen children.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
They had a pony and trap; but the pony had
got away during the night, and the father and two
or three of the children were out looking for it in
different directions.  We talked a little at intervals,
and I found him curiously ignorant concerning the
wild life of the Forest.  He assured me that he had
never seen the cuckoo, but he had heard of its
singular habits, and was anxious to know how big
a bird it was, also its colour.  In some trees near us
a wood-wren was uttering its sorrowful little wailing
note of anxiety, and when I asked him what bird it
was, he answered "a sparrer."  Nevertheless he seemed
to feel a dim sort of interest in the spiders we were
watching, and at length our intermittent conversation
ceased altogether.  When at last, after a long
silence, I spoke, he did not answer, and glancing
round I found that he had gone to sleep.  Lying
there with eyes closed, his pale face on the bright
green turf, he looked almost corpse-like.  Even his
lips were colourless.  Getting up, I placed a penny
piece on the turf beside his little crooked stick, so
that on awaking he should have a gleam of happiness
in his poor little soul, and went softly away.  But he
was sleeping very soundly, for when after going a
couple of hundred yards I looked back he was still
lying motionless on the same spot.
</p>

<p>
But when I looked back, and when, regaining the
road, I went on my way, and indeed for long hours
after, I saw the boy vaguely, almost like a boy of
mist, and was hardly able to recall his features, so
faintly had he impressed me; while the spider on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
her flower, and the small male that wooed and won
her many times yet never ventured to take her,
were stamped so vividly on my brain, that even if
I had wished it I could not have got rid of that
persistent image.  It made me miserable to think
that I had left, thousands of miles away, a world
of spiders exceeding in size, variety of shape and
beauty and richness of colouring those I found
here&mdash;surpassing them, too, in the marvellousness of
their habits and that ferocity of disposition which
is without a parallel in nature.  I wished I could
drop this burden of years so as to go back to them,
to spend half a lifetime in finding out some of their
fascinating secrets.  Finally, I envied those who in
future years will grow up in that green continent,
with this passion in their hearts, and have the
happiness which I had missed.
</p>

<p>
I, of course, knew that it was but the too vivid
and persistent image of that particular creature on
which my attention had been fixed which made me
regard spiders generally as the most interesting beings
in nature&mdash;the proper study of mankind, in fact.
But it is always so; any new aspect, form, or
manifestation of the principle of life, at the moment it
comes before the vision and the mind, is, to one
who is not a specialist, attractive beyond all others.
</p>

<p>
But, after all is said and done, I have as a fact
spent many of my Hampshire days at a distance
from the spots I love best, and my subject in this
chapter will be of my sojourn in that eastern corner
of the county, in the village and parish which all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
naturalists love, and which many of them know
so well.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Visitors to Selborne
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is told in the books that some seventy or eighty
years ago an adventurous naturalist journeyed down
from London by rough ways to the remote village of
Selborne, to see it with his own eyes and describe its
condition to the world.  The way is not long nor
rough in these times, and on every summer day,
almost at every hour of the day, strangers from all
parts of the country, with not a few from foreign
lands, may be seen in the old village street.  Of
these visitors that come like shadows, so depart,
nine in every ten, or possibly nineteen in every
twenty, have no real interest in Gilbert White and
his work and the village he lived in, but are members
of that innumerable tribe of gadders about the land
who religiously visit every spot which they are told
should be seen.
</p>

<p>
One morning, while staying at the village, in July
1901, I went at six o'clock for a stroll on the common,
and, on going up to the Hanger, noticed a couple of
bicycles lying at the foot of the hill; then, half-way
up I found the cyclists&mdash;two young ladies&mdash;resting
on the turf by the side of the Zigzag.  They were
conversing together as I went by, and one having
asked some question which I did not hear, the other
replied, "Oh no! he lived a very long time ago, and
wrote a history of Selborne.  About birds and
that."  To which the other returned, "Oh!" and then they
talked of something else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
</p>

<p>
These ladies had probably got up at four o'clock
that morning, and ridden several miles to visit the
village and go up the Hanger before breakfast.  Later
in the day they would be at other places where other
Hampshire celebrities, big and little, had been born, or
had lived or died&mdash;Wootton St. Lawrence, Chawton,
Steventon, Alresford, Basing, Otterbourne, Buriton,
Boldre, and a dozen more; and one, the informed,
would say to her uninformed companion, "Oh dear,
no; he, or she, lived a long, long time ago, somewhere
about the eighteenth century&mdash;or perhaps it was the
sixteenth&mdash;and did something, or wrote fiction, or
history, or philosophy, and that."  To which the
other would intelligently answer, "Oh!" and then
they would remount their bicycles, and go on to
some other place.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Selborne revisited
</span>
</p>

<p>
Although a large majority of the visitors are of
this description, there are others of a different
kind&mdash;the true pilgrims; and these are mostly naturalists
who have been familiar from boyhood with the
famous Letters, who love the memory of Gilbert
White, and regard the spot where he was born, to
which he was so deeply attached, where his ashes
lie, as almost a sacred place.  It is but natural that
some of these, who are the true and only Selbornians,
albeit they may not call themselves by a name which
has been filched from them, should have given an
account of a first visit, their impression of a spot
familiar in description but never realised until seen,
and of its effect on the mind.  But no one, so far as
I know, has told of a second or of any subsequent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
visit.  There is a good reason for this, for though
the place is in itself beautiful and never loses its
charm, it is impossible for anyone to recover the
feeling experienced on a first sight.  If I, unlike
others, write of Selborne revisited, it is not because
there is anything fresh to say of an old, vanished
emotion, a feeling which forms a singular and delightful
experience in the life of many a naturalist, and is
thereafter a pleasing memory but nothing more.
</p>

<p>
Selborne is now to me like any other pleasant rural
place: in the village street, in the churchyard, by
the Lyth and the Bourne, on the Hanger and the
Common, I feel that I am
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In a green and undiscovered ground;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the feeling that the naturalist must or should always
experience in all places where nature is, even as
Coventry Patmore experienced it in the presence of
women.  He had paid more than ordinary attention
to their ways, and knew that there was yet much
to learn.

How irrecoverable the first feeling is&mdash;a feeling
which may be almost like the sense of an unseen
presence, as I have described it in an account of
my first visit to Selborne in the concluding chapter
in a book on <i>Birds and Man</i>&mdash;was impressed upon
me on the occasion of a second visit two or three
years later.  There was then no return of the
feeling&mdash;no faintest trace of it.  The village was like
any other, only more interesting because of several
amusing incidents in bird-life which I by chance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
witnessed when there.  Animals in a state of nature
do not often move us to mirth, but on this occasion
I was made to laugh several times.  At first it was
at an owl at Alton.  I arrived there in the evening
of a wet, rough day in May 1898, too late to walk
the five miles that remained to my destination.
After securing a room at the hotel, I hurried out to
look at the fine old church, which Gilbert White
admired in his day; but it was growing dark, so that
there was nothing for me but to stand in the wind
and rain in the wet churchyard, and get a general
idea of the outline of the building, with its handsome,
shingled spire standing tall against the wild, gloomy
sky.  By-and-by a vague figure appeared out of the
clouds, travelling against the wind towards the
spire, and looking more like a ragged piece of
newspaper whirled about the heavens than any living
thing.  It was a white owl, and after watching him
for some time I came to the conclusion that he was
trying to get to the vane on the spire.  A very idle
ambition it seemed, for although he succeeded again
and again in getting to within a few yards of the
point aimed at, he was on each occasion struck by
a fresh violent gust and driven back to a great
distance, often quite out of sight in the gloom.
But presently he would reappear, still striving to
reach the vane.  A crazy bird! but I could not
help admiring his pluck, and greatly wondered what
his secret motive in aiming at that windy perch
could be.  And at last, after so many defeats, he
succeeded in grasping the metal cross-bar with his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
crooked talons.  The wind, with all its fury, could
not tear him from it, and after a little flapping he
was able to pull himself up; then, bending down,
he deliberately wiped his beak on the bar and flew
away!  This, then, had been his powerful, mysterious
motive&mdash;just to wipe his beak, which he could very
well have wiped on any branch or barn-roof or fence,
and saved himself that tremendous labour!
</p>

<p>
It was an extreme instance of the tyrannous effect
of habit on a wild animal.  Doubtless this bird had
been accustomed, after devouring his first mouse, to
fly to the vane, where he could rest for a few minutes,
taking a general view of the place, and wipe his
beak at the same time; and the habit had become
so strong that he could not forgo his visit even on
so tempestuous an evening.  His beak, if he had
wiped it anywhere but on that lofty cross-bar, would
not have seemed quite clean.
</p>

<p>
At Selborne, in the garden at the Wakes, I noticed
a pair of pied wagtails busy nest-building in the ivy
on the wall.  One of the birds flew up to the roof of
the house, where, I suppose, he caught sight of a fly
in an upper window which looked on to the roof, for
all at once he rose up and dashed against the pane
with great force; and as the glass pane hit back with
equal force, he was thrown on to the tiles under the
window.  Nothing daunted, he got up and dashed
against the glass a second time, with the same result.
The action was repeated five times, then the poor
baffled bird withdrew from the contest, and, drawing
in his head, sat hunched up for two or three minutes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
perfectly motionless.  The volatile creature would
not have sat there so quietly if he had not hurt
himself rather badly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cockerel and martin
</span>
</p>

<p>
One more of the amusing incidents witnessed during
my visit must be told.  Several pairs of martins were
making their nests under the eaves of a cottage
opposite to the Queen's Arms, where I stayed; and
on going out about seven o'clock in the morning, I
stood to watch some of the birds getting mud at a
pool which had been made by the night's rain in the
middle of the street.  It happened that some fowls
had come out of the inn yard, and were walking or
standing near the puddle picking up gravel or any
small morsel they could find.  Among them was a
cockerel, a big, ungainly, yellowish Cochin, in the
hobbledehoy stage of that ugliest and most ungraceful
variety.  For some time this bird stood idly by
the pool, but by-and-by the movements of the
martins coming and going between the cottage and
the puddle attracted his attention, and he began to
watch them with a strange interest; and then all
at once he made a vicious peck at one occupied in
deftly gathering a pellet of clay close to his great,
feathered feet.  The martin flitted lightly away, and
after a turn or two, dropped down again at almost
the same spot.  The fowl had watched it, and as soon
as it came down moved a step or two nearer to it
with deliberation, then made a violent dash and peck
at it, and was no nearer to hitting it than before.
The same thing occurred again and again, the martin
growing shyer after each attack; then other martins
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
came, and he, finding them less cautious than the
first, stalked them in turn and made futile attacks
on them.  Convinced at last that it was not possible
for him to injure or touch these elusive little
creatures, he determined that they should gather no
mud at that place, and with head up he watched
them circling like great flies around him, dashing
savagely at them whenever they came lower, or
paused in their flight, or dropped lightly down on
the margin.  It was a curious and amusing spectacle&mdash;the
big, shapeless, lumbering bird chasing them
round and round the pool in his stupid spite; they
by contrast so beautiful in their shining purple
mantle, snow-white breast, and stockinged feet, their
fairy-like aerial bodies that responded so quickly
to every motion of their bright, lively, little minds.
It was like a very heavy policeman "moving on"
a flock of fairies.
</p>

<p>
One remembers Æsop's dog in the manger, and
thinks that this and many of the apologues are really
nothing but everyday incidents in animal life, told
just as they happened, with the addition of speech
(in some cases quite unnecessary) put in the mouth
of the various actors.  Æsop's dog did not want to
be disturbed in his bed of hay, and was not such an
unredeemed curmudgeon as the Selborne fowl; but
this unlovely temper or feeling&mdash;spite and petty
tyranny and persecution&mdash;is exceedingly common in
the lower animals, from the higher vertebrates down
even to the insects.
</p>

<p>
My third visit to Selborne was in July 1901.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
went there on the 12th and stayed till the 23rd.  Now
July, when the business of breeding is over or far
advanced and all the best songsters are dropping
into silence, and when the foliage is deepening to a
uniform monotonous dark green, is, next to August,
the least interesting month of the year.  But at
Selborne I was singularly fortunate, although the
season was excessively dry and hot.  The heat was
indeed great all over the country, but I doubt if
there exists a warmer village than Selborne, unless
it be one in some, to me unknown, coombe in Cornwall
or Devon.  Thus on 19th July, when the temperature
rose to ninety degrees in the shade in the City
of London, we had it as high as ninety-four degrees
in Selborne.  The village lies in a kind of trough at
the foot of a wall-like hill.  If it were not for the
moisture and the greenery that surrounds and almost
covers it, hanging, as it were, like a cloud above it,
the heat would doubtless have been even greater.
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
Crickets
</span>
</p>

<p>
These conditions, in whatever way they may affect
the human inhabitants, appear to be exceedingly
favourable to the house-crickets.  It was impossible
for anyone to walk in the village of an evening
without noticing the noise they made.  The cottages
on both sides of the street seemed to be alive with
them, so that, walking, one was assailed by their
shrilling in both ears.  Hearing them so much sent
me in search of their wild cousin of the fields and
of the mole-cricket, but no sound of them could I
hear.  It was too late for them to sing.  No doubt&mdash;as
White conjectured&mdash;the artificial conditions which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
civilised man has made for the house-cricket have
considerably altered its habits.  Like the canary and
other finches that thrive in captivity, a uniform
indoor climate, with food easily found, have made
it a singer all the year round.  I trust we shall never
take to the Japanese custom of caging insects for
the sake of their music; but it is probable that a
result of keeping tamed or domesticated field-crickets
would be to set them singing at all seasons against
the cricket on the hearth.  A listener would then
be able to judge which of the two "sweet and tiny
cousins" is the better performer.  The house-cricket
has to my ears a louder, coarser, a more creaky
sound; but we hear him, as a rule, in a room, singing,
as it were, confined in a big box; and I remember
the case of the skylark, and the disagreeable effect
of its shrill and harsh spluttering song when heard
from a cage hanging against a wall.  The field-cricket,
like the soaring skylark, has the wide expanse of
open air to soften and etherealise the sound.
</p>

<p>
Gilbert White lived in an age which had its own
little, firmly-established, conventional ideas about
nature, which he, open-air man though he was, did
not escape, or else felt bound to respect.  Thus, the
prolonged, wild, beautiful call of the peacock, the
finest sound made by any domesticated creature,
was to the convention of the day "disgustful," and
as a disgustful sound he sets it down accordingly;
and when he speaks of the keen pleasure it gave
him to listen to the field-cricket, he writes in a
somewhat apologetic strain:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Sounds do not always give us pleasure according to their
sweetness and melody, nor do harsh sounds always displease.
We are more apt to be captivated or disgusted with the associations
which they promote than with the notes themselves.  Thus
the shrilling of the field-cricket, though sharp and stridulous,
yet marvellously delights some hearers, filling their minds with
a train of summer ideas of everything that is rural, verdurous,
and joyous.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The delight I know, but I cannot wholly agree
with the explanation.  A couple of months before
this visit to Selborne, on 25th May, on passing
some small grass-fields, enclosed in high, untrimmed
hedges, on the border of a pine wood near Hythe,
by Southampton Water, I all at once became
conscious of a sound, which indeed had been for some
considerable time in my ears, increasing in volume as
I went on until it forced my attention to it.  When
I listened, I found myself in a place where
field-crickets were in extraordinary abundance; there
must have been many hundreds within hearing
distance, and their delicate shrilling came from the
grass and hedges all round me.  It was as if all
the field-crickets in the county had congregated and
were holding a grand musical festival at that spot.
A dozen or twenty house-crickets in a kitchen would
have made more noise; this was not loud, nor could
it properly be described as a noise; it was more like
a subtle music without rise or fall or change; or like
a continuous, diffused, silvery-bright, musical hum,
which surrounded one like an atmosphere, and at
the same time pervaded and trembled through one
like a vibration.  It was certainly very delightful,
and the feeling in this instance was not due to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
association, but, I think, to the intrinsic beauty of the
sound itself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wild flowers
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Selborne stream, or Bourne, with its meadows
and tangled copses on either side, was my favourite
noonday haunt.  The volume of water does not
greatly diminish during the summer months, but in
many places the bed of the stream was quite grown
over with aquatic plants, topped with figwort, huge
water-agrimony, with its masses of powdery,
flesh-coloured blooms, creamy meadow-sweet, and
rose-purple loosestrife, and willow-herb with its
appetising odour of codlins and cream.  The wild musk,
or monkey-flower, a Hampshire plant about which
there will be much to say in another chapter, was
also common.  At one spot a mass of it grew at the
foot of a high bank on the water's edge; from the
top of the bank long branches of briar-rose trailed
down, and the rich, pure yellow mimulus blossoms
and ivory-white roses of the briar were seen together.
An even lovelier effect was produced at another spot
by the mingling of the yellow flowers with the large
turquoise-blue water forget-me-nots.
</p>

<p>
The most charming of the Selborne wild plants
that flower in July is the musk mallow.  It was
quite common round the village, and perhaps the
finest plant I saw was in the churchyard, growing
luxuriantly by a humble grave near the little gate
that opens to the Lyth and Bourne.  As it is known
to few persons, there must almost every day have
been strangers and pilgrims in the churchyard who
looked with admiration on that conspicuous plant,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
with its deep-cut, scented geranium-like, beautiful
leaves, tender grey-green in colour, and its profusion
of delicate, silky, rose-coloured flowers.  Many would
look on it as some rare exotic, and wonder at its
being there by that lowly green mound.  But to the
residents it was a musk mallow and nothing more&mdash;a
weed in the churchyard.
</p>

<p>
When one morning I found two men mowing the
grass, I called their attention to this plant and asked
them to spare it, telling them that it was one which
the daily visitors to the village would admire above
all the red geraniums and other gardeners' flowers
which they would have to leave untouched.  This
simple request appeared to put them out a good
deal; they took their hats off and wiped the sweat
from their foreheads, and after gravely pondering the
matter for some time, said they would "see about
it" or "bear it in mind" when they came round to
that side.  In the afternoon, when the mowing was
done, I returned and found that the musk mallow
had not been spared.
</p>

<p>
During my stay I was specially interested in two
of the common Selborne birds&mdash;the cirl bunting and
the swift.  At about four o'clock each morning the
lively, vigorous song of the cirl bunting would be
heard from the gardens or ground of the Wakes, at
the foot of the hill.  From four to six, at intervals,
was his best singing-time; later in the day he sang
at much longer intervals.  There appeared to be three
pairs of breeding birds: one at the Wakes, another
on the top of the hill to the left of the Zigzag path,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
and a third below the churchyard.  The cock bird of
the last pair sang at intervals every day during my
visit from a tree in the churchyard, and from a big
sycamore growing at the side of it.  On 14th July
I had a good opportunity of judging the penetrative
power of this bunting's voice, for by chance, just
as the bells commenced ringing for the six o'clock
Sunday evening service, the bird, perched on a
small cypress in the churchyard, began to sing.
Though only about forty yards from the tower, he
was not in the least discomposed by the clanging
of the bells, but sang at proper intervals the usual
number of times&mdash;six or eight&mdash;his high, incisive
voice sounding distinct through that tempest of
jangled metallic music.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cirl bunting
</span>
</p>

<p>
I was often at Farringdon, a village close by, and
there, too, the churchyard had its cirl bunting,
singing merrily at intervals from a perch not above
thirty yards from the building.  And as at Selborne
and Farringdon, so I have found it in most places in
Hampshire, especially in the southern half of the
county; the cirl is the village bunting whose favourite
singing place is in the quiet churchyard or the
shade-trees at the farm: compared with other members of
the genus he might almost be called our domestic
bunting.  The yellowhammer is never heard in a
village: at Selborne to find him one had to climb
the hill and go out on the common, and there he
could be heard drawling out his lazy song all day
long.  How curious to think that Gilbert White never
distinguished between these two species, although it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
is probable that he heard the cirl on every summer
day during the greater part of his life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Visiting swifts
</span>
</p>

<p>
The swifts at Selborne interested me even more,
and I spent a good many hours observing them; but
the swifts I watched were not, strange to say, the
native Selborne birds.  When I arrived I took
particular notice of the swallows and swifts&mdash;a natural
thing to do in Gilbert White's village.  The swallows,
I was sorry to find, had decreased so greatly in
numbers since my former visits that there were but few
left.  The house-martins, though still not scarce, had
also fallen off a good deal.  Of swifts there were
about eight or nine pairs, all with young in their
nests, in holes under the eaves of different cottages.
The old birds appeared to be very much taken up
with feeding their young: they ranged about almost
in solitude, never more than four or five birds being
seen together, and that only in the evening, and even
when in company they were silent and their flight
comparatively languid.  This continued from the 12th
to the 16th, but on that day, at a little past seven
o'clock in the evening, I was astonished to see a
party of over fifty swifts rushing through the air
over the village in the usual violent way, uttering
excited screams as they streamed by.  Rising to some
height in the air, they would scatter and float above
the church for a few moments, then close and rush
down and stream across the Plestor, coming as low
as the roofs of the cottages, then along the village
street for a distance of forty or fifty yards, after
which they would mount up and return to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
church, to repeat the same race over the same
course again and again.  They continued their
pastime for an hour or longer, after which the flock
began to diminish, and in a short time had quite
melted away.
</p>

<p>
On the following evening I was absent, but some
friends staying at the village watched for me, and
they reported that the birds appeared after seven
o'clock and played about the place for an hour or
two, then vanished as before.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the 18th I went with my friends
to the ground behind the churchyard, from which a
view of the sky all round can be obtained.  Four or
five swifts were visible quietly flying about the sky,
all wide apart.  At six o'clock a little bunch of half
a dozen swifts formed, and began to chase each
other in the usual way, and more birds, singly, and
in twos and threes, began to arrive.  Some of these
were seen coming to the spot from the direction of
Alton.  Gradually the bunch grew until it was a big
crowd numbering seventy to eighty birds, and as it
grew the excitement of the birds increased: until
eight o'clock they kept up their aerial mad gambols,
and then, as on the previous evenings, the flock
gradually dispersed.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the 19th the performance was
repeated, the birds congregated numbering about
sixty.  On the 20th the number had diminished to
about forty, and an equal number returned on the
following evening; and this was the last time.  We
watched in vain for them on the 22nd: no swifts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
but the half-a-dozen Selborne birds usually to be
seen towards evening were visible; nor did they return
on any other day up to the 24th, when my visit came
to an end.
</p>

<p>
It is possible, and even probable, that these swifts
which came from a distance to hold their evening
games at Selborne were birds that had already finished
breeding, and were now free to go from home and
spend a good deal of time in purely recreative
exercises.  The curious point is that they should have
made choice of this sultry spot for such a purpose.
It was, moreover, new to me to find that swifts do
sometimes go a distance from home to indulge in
such pastimes.  I had always thought that the birds
seen pursuing each other with screams through the
sky at any place were the dwellers and breeders in
the locality; and this is probably the idea that most
persons have.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I wish I could have visited Selborne again last
July, in order to find out whether or not the evening
gatherings and pastimes of the swifts occur annually.
But I was engaged elsewhere, and at the village I
failed to discover any person with interest enough
in such subjects to watch for me.  It would have
been very strange if I had found such a one.
</p>

<p>
It was not until October 1902 that I went back,
two months after the swifts had gone; but I was well
occupied for two or three weeks during this latest
visit in observing the ways of a grasshopper.
</p>

<p>
There has already been much about insects in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
this book, and it may seem that I am giving a
disproportionate amount of space to these negligible
atomies; nevertheless I should not like to conclude
this chapter without adding an account of yet
another species, one indeed worthy to rank among
the Insect Notables of Southern England described
in a former chapter.  The account comes best in this
place, since the species had seemed rare, or nowhere
abundant, until, in October, I found it most common
in Selborne parish; and here I came to know it well,
as I had come to know its great green relation,
<i>Locusta viridissima</i>, at Longparish.  Both are of
one family, and are night singers, but the Selborne
insect belongs to a different genus&mdash;<i>Thamnotrizon</i>&mdash;of
which it is the only British representative; and
in colour and habits it differs widely from the green
grasshoppers.  The members of this charming family
are found in all warm and temperate countries
throughout the world: in this island we may say
that they are at the extreme northern limit of their
range.  Of our nine British species only three are
found north of the Thames.  <i>Thamnotrizon cinereus</i>
is one of these, but is mainly a southern species, and
the latest of our grasshoppers to come to maturity.
In September it is full grown, and may be heard
until November.  It is much smaller than <i>viridissima</i>,
and is very dark in colour, the female, which has no
vestige of wings, being of a uniform deep olive-brown,
except the under surface, which is bright
buttercup-yellow.  The male, though smaller than
the female, and like her in colour, has a more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
distinguished appearance on account of his small
aborted wings, which serve as an instrument of
music, and form a disc of ashy grey colour on his
black and brown body.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The black grasshopper
</span>
</p>

<p>
Unless looked at closely this insect appears black,
and might very well be called the black grasshopper.
And here it is necessary once more to protest against
what must be regarded as a gross neglect of a plain
duty on the part of writers on our native insects who
will not give English names even to the most common
and interesting species.  Unless it has a vernacular
name they will go on speaking of it as <i>Thamnotrizon
cinereus</i>, <i>Cordulegaster annulatus</i>, or whatever it may
be, to the end of time.  This grasshopper has no
common name that I can discover: I have caught
and shown it to the country people, asking them
to name it, and they informed me that it was a
"grasshopper," or else a "cricket."  Black, or black
and yellow, or autumn grasshopper would do very
well: but any English name would be better than
the entomologist's ponderous double name
compounded out of two dead languages.
</p>

<p>
Our black grasshopper lives in grass and herbage,
in the shade of bushes and trees, and so long as the
weather is hot it is hard to find him, as he keeps in
the shade.  He is furthermore the shyest and wariest
of his family, and ready to vanish on the least alarm.
He does not leap, but slips away into hiding; and
if one goes too near, or attempts to take him, he
suddenly vanishes.  He simply drops down through
the leaves to the earth, and sits close and motionless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
at the roots on the dark mould, and unless touched
will not move.  When traced down to his hiding-place
he leaps away, and again sits motionless, where,
owing to his dark colour on the dark soil, he is
invisible.  Later, when the weather grows cool, he comes
out and sits on a leaf, basking by the hour in the sun,
his eyes turned from it; and it is then easy to find him,
the dark colour making him appear very conspicuous
on a green leaf.  Occasionally he sings in the afternoon,
but, as a rule, he begins at dusk, and continues
for some hours.  To sing, the males often go high up
in the bushes, and when emitting their sound are
almost constantly on the move.
</p>

<p>
The sound is a cricket-like chirp; it is never
sustained, but in quality it resembles the subtle
musical shrilling of the <i>viridissima</i>, although it does
not carry half so far.
</p>

<p>
In disposition the two species, the black and great
green grasshoppers, are very unlike.  The female
<i>viridissima</i>, we have seen, is the most indolent and
placid creature imaginable, while the males are
perpetually challenging and fighting one another.  The
males of the black grasshopper I could never detect
fighting.  It is not easy to observe them, as they sing
mostly at night; and as a rule when singing they are
well hidden by the leaves.  But I have occasionally
found two males singing together, apparently against
each other, when I would watch them, and although
as they moved about they constantly passed and
repassed so close that they all but touched, they never
struck at each other, nor put themselves into fighting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
attitudes.  One day I found two males sitting on a
leaf together, side by side, like the best of friends,
basking in the sun.
</p>

<p>
The female, on the other hand, is a most unpleasant
creature, so restless that in confinement she
spends the whole time in running about in her cage
or box, incessantly trying to get out, examining
everything, eating of everything given her, and
persecuting any other insect placed with her.  When
I put males and females together the poor males
were kicked and bitten until they died.
</p>

<p>
Before visiting Selborne in October, it had seemed
to me that hunting for this grasshopper was a most
fascinating pursuit.  It was very hard to find him
by day, and when by chance you caught sight of
him, sitting on a green leaf in the sun and looking
like a small, very dark-coloured frog with abnormally
long hind legs, it was generally in a bramble bush,
into which he would vanish when approached too near.
</p>

<p>
When at Selborne, one evening I heard one singing
among the herbage at the foot of the Hanger, and
next morning I found one at the same spot&mdash;a
female, sitting on a gold-red fallen beech leaf, her
blackness on the brilliant leaf making her very
conspicuous.  A little later, when the wet weather
improved, I found the grasshopper all about the
village, and even in it; but it was most abundant
near the Well Head and in the hedges between
Selborne and Nore Hill.  Here on a sunny morning I
could find a score or more of them, and at dark they
could be heard in numbers chirping in all the hedges.

It is a pleasure to be at Selborne; nevertheless
I find I always like Selborne best when I am
out of it, especially when I am rambling about
that bit of beautiful country on the border of which
it lies.  The memory of Gilbert White; the old church
with its low, square tower and its famous yew tree;
above all, the constant sight of the Hanger clothed
in its beechen woods&mdash;green, or bronze and red-gold,
or purple-brown in leafless winter&mdash;all these things
do not prevent a sense of lassitude, of ill-being, which
I experience in the village when I am too long in it,
and which vanishes when I quit it, and seem to
breathe a better air.  This is no mere fancy, nor
something peculiar to myself; the natives, too, are
subject to this secret trouble, and are, some of them,
conscious of it.  Round about Selborne you will find
those who were born and bred in the village, who say
they were never well until they quitted it; and some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
of these declare that they would not return even if
some generous person were to offer them a cottage
rent free.  The appearance of the people, too, may be
considered in this connection.  Mary Russell Mitford
exclaims in one of her village sketches that there was
not a pretty face in the country-side.  The want of
comeliness which is so noticeable in the southern
parts of Berkshire is not confined to that county.
The people of Berkshire and Hampshire, of the
blonde type, are very much alike.  But there are
degrees; and if you want to see, I will not say a
handsome, nor a pretty, but a passably fresh and
pleasant face among the cottagers, you must go
out of Selborne to some neighbouring village to
look for it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Selborne Common
</span>
</p>

<p>
But this question does not now concern us.  The
best of Selborne is the common on the hill&mdash;all the
better for the steep hill which must be climbed to
get to it, since that difficult way prevents the people
from making too free use of it, and regarding it as
a sort of back-yard or waste place to throw their
rubbish on.  It is a perpetual joy to the children.
One morning in October I met there some youngsters
gathering kindling-wood, and feasting at the same
time on wild fruits&mdash;the sloes were just then at their
best.  They told me that they had only recently
come to live in Selborne from Farringdon, their native
village.  "And which place do you like best?" I
asked.  "Selborne!" they shouted in a breath, and
indeed appeared surprised that I had asked such a
question.  No wonder.  This hill-top common is the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
most forest-like, the wildest in England, and the
most beautiful as well, both in its trees and tangles
of all kinds of wild plants that flourish in waste
places, and in the prospects which one gets of the
surrounding country.  Here, seeing the happiness of
the boys, I have wished to be a boy again.  But one
does not think so much of this spot when one comes
to know the country round, and finds that Selborne
Hill is but one of many hills of the same singular
and beautiful type, sloping away gently on one side,
and presenting a bold, almost precipitous front on
the other, in most cases clothed on the steep side
with dense beech woods.  It is now eight years since
I began to form an acquaintance with this east corner
of Hampshire, but not until last October (1902) did
I know how beautiful it was.  From Selborne Hill
one sees something of it; a better sight is obtained
from Noire Hill, where one is able to get some idea
of the peculiar character of the scenery.  It is all
wildly irregular, high and low grounds thrown
together in a pretty confusion, and the soil everywhere
fertile, so that the general effect is of extreme
richness.  One sees, too, that the human population is
sparse, and that it has always been as it is now, and
man's work&mdash;his old irregular fields, and the unkept
hedges which, like the thickets on the waste places,
are self-planted, and have been self-planted for
centuries, and the old deep-winding lanes and
by-roads&mdash;have come at last to seem one with nature's
work.  Out of this broken, variegated, richly green
surface, here and there, in a sort of range, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
irregular like all else, the hills, or hangers, lift their
steep, bank-like fronts&mdash;splendid masses of red and
russet gold against the soft grey-blue autumnal sky.
It is delightful to walk through this bit of country
from Nore Hill, and from hill to hill, across green
fields, for the farms here are like wild lands that all
are free to use, to Wheatham Hill, the highest point,
which rises 800 feet above the sea-level.  From this
elevation one looks over a great part of that green
variegated country of the Hangers, and sees on one
hand where it fades close by into the sand and pine
district beginning at Wolmer Forest, and on another
side, beyond the little town of Petersfield, the region
of great rolling downs stretching far away into Sussex.

Village churches
</span>
</p>

<p>
In my rambles about this corner of Hampshire,
during which I visited all the villages nearest to
Selborne&mdash;Empshott, Hawkley, Greatham, East and
West Tisted, Worldham, Priors Dean, Colemore,
Privett, Froxfield, Hartley Maudit, Blackmore,
Oakhanger, Kingsley, Farringdon and Newton Valence&mdash;I
could not help thinking a good deal about Hampshire
village churches generally.  It was a subject
which had often enough been in my mind before in
other parts of the county, but it now came back
to me in connection with Gilbert White's strictures
on these sacred buildings.  Their "meanness" produced
a feeling in him which is the nearest approach
to indignation discoverable in his pages.  He is speaking
of jackdaws breeding in rabbit holes, and shrewdly
conjectures that this habit has arisen on account of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
the absence of steeples and towers suitable as
nesting-places.  "Many Hampshire places of worship," he
remarks, "make no better appearance than
dovecotes."  He envied Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire,
the Fens of Lincolnshire, and other districts,
the number of spires which presented themselves in
every point of view, and concludes: "As an admirer
of prospects I have reason to lament this want in
my own county, for such objects are very necessary
ingredients in an elegant landscape."
</p>

<p>
The honoured historian of the parish of Selborne
makes me shudder in this passage.  But I am, perhaps,
giving too much importance to his words, since one
may judge, from his mention of Norfolk in this
connection as being even worse off than his own county,
that he was not well informed on the subject.
Norfolk, like Somerset, abounds in grand old churches
of the Perpendicular period.  That smallness, or
"meanness" as he expresses it, of the Hampshire
churches, is, to my mind, one of their greatest merits.
The Hampshire village would not possess that charm
which we find in it&mdash;its sweet rusticity and
homeliness, and its harmonious appearance in the midst
of a nature green and soft and beautiful&mdash;but for
that essential feature and part of it, the church which
does not tower vast and conspicuous as a gigantic
asylum or manufactory from among lowly cottages
dwarfed by its proximity to the appearance of
pigmy-built huts in the Aruwhimi forest.  These immense
churches which in recent years have lifted their tall
spires and towers amidst lowly surroundings in many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
rural places, are, as a rule, the work of some zealot
who has seared his sense of beauty with a hot iron,
or else of a new over-rich lord of the manor, who
must have all things new, including a big new church
to worship a new God in&mdash;his own peculiar Stock
Exchange God, who is a respecter of wealthy persons.
Here in Hampshire we have seen the old but well
preserved village church pulled down&mdash;doubtless
with the consent of the ecclesiastical authorities&mdash;its
ancient monuments broken up and carted away,
its brasses made into fire ornaments by cottagers
or sold as old metal, and the very gravestones used
in paving the scullery and offices of the grand new
parsonage built to match the grand new church.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Peasants' religious feeling
</span>
</p>

<p>
When coming upon one of these "necessary
ingredients in an elegant landscape" in some rural
spot I have sometimes wondered what the feeling
of the people who have spent their lives there can
be about it.  What effect has the new vast building,
with its highly decorated yet cold and vacant
interior, on their dim minds&mdash;on their religion, let us
say?  It may be a poor unspiritual sort of religion,
based on old traditions and associations, mostly
local; but shall we scorn it on that account?  If
we look a little closely into the matter, we see that
all men, even the most intellectual, the most spiritual,
are subject to this feeling in some degree, that it is
in all religions.  That which from use, from association,
becomes symbolic of faith is in itself sacred.
At the present time the Church is torn with dissensions
because of this very question.  Certain bodily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
positions and signs and gestures, and woven fabrics
and garments of many patterns and colours, and wood
and stone and metal objects, and lighted candles and
perfumes&mdash;mere hay and stubble to others who have
different symbols&mdash;are things essential to worship in
some.  Touch these things and you hurt their souls;
you deprive them of their means of communication
with another world.  So the poor peasant who was
born and lives in a thatched cottage, with his limited
intelligence, his animism, associates the idea of the
unseen world with the sacred objects he has seen
and known and handled&mdash;the small ancient building,
the red-barked, dark-leafed yew, the green mounds
and lichened gravestones among which he played
as a child, and the dim, low-roofed interior of what
was to him God's House.  Whatever there is in
his mind that is least earthly, whatever thoughts
he may have of the unseen world and a life beyond
this life, were inseparably bound up with these
visible things.
</p>

<p>
We need not follow this line any farther; those who
believe with me that the sense of the beautiful is
God's best gift to the human soul will see that I have
put the matter on other and higher grounds.  The small
village church with its low tower or grey-shingled
spire among the shade trees, is beautiful chiefly
because man and nature with its softening processes
have combined to make it a fit part of the scene, a
building which looks as natural and harmonious as
an old hedge which man planted once and nature
replanted many times, and as many an old thatched
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
timbered cottage, and many an old grey ruin,
ivy-grown, with red valerian blooming on its walls.
</p>

<p>
To pull down one of these churches to put in its
place a gigantic Gothic structure in brick or stone,
better suited in size (and ugliness) for a London or
Liverpool church than for a small rustic village in
Hampshire, is nothing less than a crime.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Seeking Priors Dean
</span>
</p>

<p>
When calling to mind the churches known to me
in this part of Hampshire, I always think with
peculiar pleasure of the smaller ones, and perhaps with
the most pleasure of the smallest of all&mdash;Priors Dean.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the maps which I use in my
Hampshire rambles and which I always considered
the best&mdash;Bartholomew's two miles to the inch&mdash;did
not mark Priors Dean, so that I had to go and
find it for myself.  I went with a friend one
excessively hot day in July, by Empshott and Hawkley
through deep by-roads so deep and narrow and roofed
over with branches as to seem in places like tunnels.
On that hot day in the silent time of year it was
strangely still, and gave one the feeling of being in
a country long deserted by man.  Its only inhabitants
now appeared to be the bullfinches.  In these deep
shaded lanes one constantly hears the faint plaintive
little piping sound, the almost inaudible alarm note
of the concealed bird; and at intervals, following
the sound, he suddenly dashes out, showing his
sharp-winged shape and clear grey and black upper
plumage marked with white for a moment or two
before vanishing once more in the overhanging foliage.
</p>

<p>
We went a long way round, but at last coming to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
an open spot we saw two cottages and two women
and a boy standing talking by a gate, and of these
people we asked the way to Priors Dean.  They could
not tell us.  They knew it was not far away&mdash;a mile
perhaps; but they had never been to it, nor seen it,
and didn't well know the direction.  The boy when
asked shook his head.  A middle-aged man was digging
about thirty yards away, and to him one of the
women now called, "Can you tell them the way to
Priors Dean?"
</p>

<p>
The man left off digging, straightened himself, and
gazed steadily at us for some moments.  He was one
of the usual type&mdash;nine in every ten farm labourers
in this corner of Hampshire are of it&mdash;thinnish, of
medium height, a pale, parchment face, rather large
straightish nose, pale eyes with little speculation in
them, shaved mouth and chin, and small side whiskers
as our fathers wore them.  The moustache has not
yet been adopted by these conservatives.  The one
change they have made is, alas! in their dress&mdash;the
rusty black coat for the smock frock.
</p>

<p>
When he had had his long gaze, he said, "Priors
Dean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Priors Dean," repeated the woman, raising
her voice.
</p>

<p>
He turned up two spadefuls of earth, then asked
again, "Priors Dean?"
</p>

<p>
"Priors Dean!" shouted the woman.  "Can't you
tell 'em how to get to it?"  Then she laughed.  She
had perhaps come from some other part of the country
where minds are not quite so slow, and where the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
slow-minded person is treated as being deaf and
shouted at.
</p>

<p>
Then, at last, he stuck his spade into the soil, and
leaving it, slowly advanced to the gate and told us
to follow a path which he pointed out, and when we
got on the hill we would see Priors Dean before us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Churches old and new
</span>
</p>

<p>
And that was how we found it.  There is a satirical
saying in the other villages that if you want to find
the church at Priors Dean you must first cut down
the nettles.  There were no nettles nor weeds of any
kind, only the small ancient church with its little
shingled spire standing in the middle of a large
green graveyard with about a dozen or fifteen
gravestones scattered about, three old tombs, and, close
to the building, an ancient yew tree.  This is a big,
and has been a bigger, tree, as a large part of the
trunk has perished on one side, but as it stands it
measures nearly twenty-four feet round a yard from
the earth.  This, with a small farmhouse, in old times
a manor house, and its outbuildings and a cottage
or two, make the village.  So quiet a spot is it that to
see a human form or hear a human voice comes almost
as a surprise.  The little antique church, the few stones,
the dark ancient tree&mdash;these are everything, and the
effect on the mind is strangely grateful&mdash;a sense of
enduring peace, with something of that solitariness
and desolation which we find in unspoilt wildernesses.
</p>

<p>
From these smallest churches, which appear like
a natural growth where they are seen, I turn to the
large and new, and the largest of all at this place&mdash;that
of Privett.  From its gorgeous yet vacant and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
cold interior, and from the whole vast structure,
including that necessary ingredient in an elegant
landscape, the soaring spire visible for many miles
around, I turn away as from a jarring and discordant
thing&mdash;the feeling one experiences at the sight of
those brand-new big houses built by over-rich
stock-jobbers on many hills and open heaths in Surrey
and, alas! in Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
I do not, however, say that all new and large
churches raised in small rustic centres appear as
discordant things.  Even in the group of villages
which I have named there is a new and comparatively
large one which moves one to admiration
the church of Blackmoor.  Here the vegetation and
surroundings are unlike those which accord best
with the small typical structures, the low tower and
shingled spire.  The tall, square tower of Blackmoor,
of white stone roofed with red tiles, rises amid the
pines of Wolmer Forest, simple and beautiful in
shape, and gives a touch of grace and grateful colour
to that darker, austere nature.  From every point of
view it is a pleasure to the eye, and because of its
enduring beauty the memory of the man who raised
it is like a perfume in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, time that bestows the best grace,
the indescribable charm to the village church&mdash;long
centuries of time, which gives the feeling, the
expression, of immemorial peace to the weathered and
ivied building itself and the surrounding space, the
churchyard, with its green heaps, and scattered
stones, and funeral yew.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Change in gravestones
</span>
</p>

<p>
The associated feeling, the <i>expression</i>, is
undoubtedly the chief thing in the general effect, but
the constituents or objects which compose the scene
are in themselves pleasing; and one scarcely less
important than the building itself, the universal
grass, the dark, red-barked tree, is the gravestone.
I mean the gravestone that is attractive in shape,
which may be seen in every old village churchyard
in Hampshire; for not all the stones are of this
character.  The stone that is beautiful dates back
half a century at least, but very few are as old as
a century and a half.  When we get that far and
farther back the inscription is obliterated or
indecipherable.  Only here and there we may by chance
find some stone, half buried in the soil, of an
exceptional hardness, marking the spot where lieth one
who departed this life in the seventeenth or early
in the eighteenth century.  There are many old stones,
it is true, with nothing legible on them, but one does
not know how old they are.  It is not that these
gravestones are beautiful only because they are old,
and have had their hard surface softened and
embroidered with green moss and lichen of many shades
from pale-grey to orange and red and brown.  The
form of the stone, the stone-cutter's work, was
beautiful before Nature began to work on it with her
sunshine, her rain, her invisible seed.  I cannot think
why this old fashion, or rather, let us say, this tender,
sacred custom, of marking the last resting-place of
the dead with a memorial satisfying to the æsthetic
sense, should have gone or died out.  The gravestones
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
used at the present time are, as a rule, twice as big
as the old ones, and are perfectly plain&mdash;immense
stone slabs, inscribed with big, fat, black letters
differing in size, the whole inscription curiously
resembling the local auctioneer's bills to be seen
pasted up on barn-doors, fences, and other suitable
places.  So big and hard, and bold, and ugly&mdash;I try
not to see them!
</p>

<p>
Look from these at the old stone which the earthworms
have been busy trying to bury for a century,
until the lower half of the inscription is underground;
the stone which the lichen has embossed and richly
coloured; round which the grass grows so close and
lovingly, and the small creeping ivy tries to cover.
This which has been added to it is but a part of its
beauty: you see that its lines are graceful, that they
were made so; that the inscription&mdash;"Here lyeth
the body," etc.&mdash;is not cut in letters in use in
newspapers and advertising placards, and have
therefore no common nor degrading associations, but are
letters of other forms, graceful, too, in their lines;
and that above the inscription there are sculptured
and symbolic figures and lines&mdash;emblems of
mortality, eternal hope, and a future life&mdash;heads of
cherubs, winged and blowing on horns, and the sun
and wings; skulls and crossbones, and hour-glass
and scythe; the funeral urn and weeping-willow;
the lighted torch; the heart in flames, or bleeding,
or transfixed with arrows; the angel's trumpet, the
crown of glory, the palm and the lily, the laurel
leaf, and many more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
Did we think this art, or this custom, too little a
thing to cherish any longer?  I cannot find any
person with a word to say about it.  I have tried
and the result was curious.  I have invited persons
of my acquaintance into an old churchyard and
begged them to look on this stone and on this&mdash;the
hard ugliness of one, an insult to the dead, and the
beauty, the pathos, of the other.  And they have
immediately fallen into a melancholy silence, or
else they have suddenly become angry, apparently
for no cause.  But the reason probably was that they
had never given a thought to the subject, that when
they had buried someone dear to them&mdash;a mother
or wife or daughter&mdash;they simply went to the
stonemason and ordered a gravestone, leaving him to
fashion it in his own way.  The reason of the reason&mdash;the
full explanation of the singular fact that they,
in these house-beautiful and generally art-worshipping
times, had given no thought to the matter
until it was unexpectedly sprung upon them; and
that if they had lived, say, a hundred years ago,
they would have given it some thought&mdash;this the
reader will easily find out for himself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Beauty of old gravestones
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is comforting to reflect that gravestones do not
last for ever, nor for very long; and in the meantime
Nature is doing what she can with our ugly
modern memorials, touching, softening, and tingeing
them with her mosses, lichens, and with algæ&mdash;her
beautiful <i>iolithus</i>.  In most churchyards in
southern England we see many stones stained a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
peculiar colour, a bright rust-red, darkest in dry
weather, and brightest in wet summers, often
varying to pink and purple and orange; but whatever
the hue or shade the effect on the grey stone, lichened
or not, is always beautiful.  It is not a lichen; when
the staining is looked closely at nothing is seen but
a roughness, a powdery appearance, on the stone's
surface.  It is an aerial alga of the genus <i>Croöleptus</i>,
confined to the southern half of England, and most
common in Hampshire, where its beautifying blush
may sometimes be seen on old stone walls of churches,
and old houses and ruins; but it flourishes most
on gravestones, especially in moist situations.  The
stone must not be too hard, and must, moreover, be
acted on by the weather for well-nigh half a century
before the alga begins to show on it; but you will
sometimes see it on an exceptionally soft stone dating
no more than thirty or forty years back.  On old
stones it is very common, and peculiarly beautiful
in wet summers.  In June 1902, after many days of
rain, I stood one evening at the little gate at
Brockenhurst churchyard, and counted between me and the
church twenty gravestones stained with the red alga,
showing a richness and variety of colouring never
seen before, the result of so much wet weather.  For
this alga, which plays so important a part in nature's
softening and beautifying effect on man's work&mdash;which
is mentioned in no book unless it be some
purely technical treatise dealing with the lower
vegetable forms&mdash;this alga, despite its aerial habit,
is still in essence a water-plant: the sun and dry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
wind burn its life out and darken it to the colour
of ironstone, so that to anyone who may notice the
dark stain it seems a colour of the stone itself; but
when rain falls the colour freshens and brightens
as if the old grey stone had miraculously been
made to live.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Churchyard yews
</span>
</p>

<p>
If never a word has been written about that red
colour with which Nature touches the old stones to
make them beautiful, a thousand or ten thousand
things have been said about the yew, the chief
feature and ornament of the village churchyard, and
many conjectures have we seen as to the reason
of the very ancient custom of planting this tree
where the dead are laid.  The tree itself gives a
better reason than any contained in books.  It says
something to the soul in man which the talking or
chattering yew omitted to tell the modern poet; but
very long ago someone said, in the <i>Death of Fergus</i>,
"Patriarch of long-lasting woods is the yew; sacred
to forests as is well known."  That ancient sacred
character, which survived the introduction of
Christianity, lives still in every mind that has kept any
vestige of animism, the root and essence of all that
is wonderful and sacred in nature.  That red and
purple bark is the very colour of life, and this tree's
life, compared with other things, is everlasting.  The
stones we set up as memorials grow worn and seamed
and hoary with age, even like men, and crumble to
dust at last; in time new stones are put in their
place, and these, too, grow old and perish, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
are succeeded by others; and through all changes,
through the ages, the tree lives on unchanged.  With
its huge, tough, red trunk; its vast, knotted arms
outstretched; its rich, dark mantle of undying
foliage, it stands like a protecting god on the earth,
patriarch and monarch of woods; and indeed it
seems but right and natural that not to oak nor
holly, nor any other reverenced tree, but to the yew
it was given to keep guard over the bodies and souls
of those who have been laid in the earth.
</p>

<p>
The yew is sometimes called the "Hampshire
weed," on account of its abundance in the county;
if it must have a second name, I suggest that the
Hampshire or British dragon-tree would be a better
and more worthy one.  It would admirably fit some
ancient churchyard yews in the neighbourhood of
Selborne, especially that of Farringdon.
</p>

<p>
In the great mass of literature concerning Gilbert
White, there is curiously little said about this village;
yet it has one of the most interesting old churches
in the county&mdash;the church in which White officiated
for over a quarter of a century, during all the best
years of his life, in fact; for when he resigned the
curacy at Farringdon to take that of Selborne, for
which he had waited so long, he was within two
years of bidding a formal farewell to natural history,
and within eight of his death.  The church register
from 1760 to 1785 is written in his clear, beautiful
hand, and in the rectory garden there is a large
Spanish chestnut-tree planted by him.  Although not
so fortunate in its surroundings as Selborne, with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
its Lyth and flowery Bourne and wooded Hanger,
Farringdon village, with its noble church and fine
old farm-buildings and old cottages, is the better
village of the two.  At the side of the churchyard
there is an old oast-house, now used as a barn, which
for quaintness and beauty has hardly its match in
England.  The churchyard itself is a pretty, peaceful
wilderness, deep in grass, with ivy and bramble
hanging to the trees, and spreading over tombs and
mounds.  Long may it be kept sacred from the
gardener, with his abhorred pruning-hook, his basket
of geranium cuttings&mdash;inharmonious flower!&mdash;and his
brushwood broom to make it all tidy.  Finally, there
is the wonderful old yew.

Farringdon yew

<p>
A great deal has been written first and last about
the Selborne yew, which appears to rank as one of
the half-dozen biggest yew trees in the country.  Its
age is doubtless very great, and may greatly exceed
the "thousand years" usually given to a very large
churchyard yew.  The yews planted two hundred
years ago by Gilbert White's grandfather in the
parsonage garden close by, are but saplings in
comparison.  A black poplar would grow a bigger
trunk in less than ten years.  The Selborne yew was
indeed one of the antiquities of the village when
White described it a century and a quarter ago.  It
is, moreover, the best-grown, healthiest, and most
vigorous-looking yew of its size in Britain.  The
Farringdon yew, the bigger tree, has a far more aged
aspect&mdash;the appearance of a tree which has been
decaying for an exceedingly long period.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
</p>

<p>
Trees, like men, have their middle period, when
their increase slowly lessens until it ceases altogether;
their long stationary period, and their long decline:
each of these periods may, in the case of the yew,
extend to centuries; and we know that behind them
all there may have been centuries of slow growth.
The Selborne yew has added something to its girth
since it was measured by White, and is now twenty-seven
feet round in its biggest part, and exceeds by
at least three feet the big yew at Priors Dean, and
the biggest of the three churchyard yews at Hawkley.
The Farringdon yew in its biggest part, about five
feet from the ground, measures thirty feet, and to
judge by its ruinous condition it must have ceased
adding to its bulk more than a century ago.  One
regrets that White gave no account of its size and
appearance in his day.  It has, in the usual manner,
decayed above and below, the upper branches dying
down while the trunk rots away beneath, the tree
meanwhile keeping itself alive and renewing its youth,
as it were, by means of that power which the yew
possesses of saving portions of its trunk from complete
decay by covering them inside and out with new bark.
</p>

<p>
In the churchyard yew at Crowhurst, Surrey, we
see that the upper part of the tree has decayed until
nothing but the low trunk, crowned with a poor fringe
of late branches, has been left; in this case the
trunk remains outwardly almost entire&mdash;an empty
shell or cylinder, large enough to accommodate
fourteen persons on the circular bench placed within
the cavity.  In other cases we see that the trunk has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
been eaten through and through, and split up into
strips; that the strips, covered inside with new bark,
have become separate trunks, in some instances
united above, as in that of the yew in South Hayling
churchyard.  The Farringdon tree has decayed below
in this way; long strips from the top to the roots
have rotted and turned to dust; and the sound
portions, covered in and out with bark, form a group
of half a dozen flattened boles, placed in a circle, all
but one, which springs from the middle, and forms
a fantastically twisted column in the centre of the
edifice.  Between this central strangely shaped bole,
now dead, and the surrounding ring there is space for
a man to walk round in.
</p>

<p>
It is a wonderful tree, which White looked at every
day for five-and-twenty years, yet never mentioned,
and which Loe says nothing about in his <i>Yew Trees of
Great Britain and Ireland</i>.  The title of this work is
misleading: <i>Famous Yew Trees</i> it should have been,
since it is nothing but a collection of facts as to size,
supposed age, etc., of trees that have often been
measured and described, and are accordingly well
known.  It is well, to my way of thinking, that he
attempted nothing more.  It is always a depressing
thought, when one has discovered a wonderful or a
beautiful thing, that a very full and very exact
account of it is and must be contained in some musty
monograph by some industrious, dreary person.  At
all events, I can say that the yew trees which have
most attracted me, which come up when I think of
the yew as a wonderful and a sacred tree, are not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
in the book.  Of my Hampshire favourites I will, for
a special reason, speak of but one more&mdash;the yew
in the churchyard of Hurstbourne Priors, a small
village on the upper Test, near Andover.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hurstbourne Priors yew
</span>
</p>

<p>
This tree, which is doubtless very aged, has not
grown an enormous trunk, nor is it high for an old
yew, but its appearance is nevertheless strangely
impressive, owing to the length of its lower horizontal
branches, which extend to a distance of thirty
to thirty-five feet from the trunk, and would lie on
the ground if not kept up by props.  Another thing
which make one wonder is the number of graves
that are crowded together beneath these vast
sheltering arms.  One may count over thirty stones,
some very old; many more have probably perished,
and there are besides many green mounds.  I have
watched in a churchyard in the Midlands a grave
being dug under a yew, at about three yards' distance
from the trunk: a barrowful of roots was taken out
during the process.  It seemed to me that a very
serious injury was being inflicted on the tree, and it
is probable that many of our very old churchyard
yews have been dwarfed in their growth by such
cutting of the roots.  But what shall we say of the
Hurstbourne Priors yew, from which not one but
thirty or forty barrow-loads of living roots must have
been taken at various times to make room for so
many coffins!  And what is the secret of the custom
in this, and probably other villages, of putting the
dead so close to or under the shelter of the tree?
</p>

<p>
Compare this Hurstbourne Priors yew, and many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
other ancient churchyard yews in Hampshire, with
that of Selborne, which albeit probably no older is
double their size: is it not probable that the Selborne
tree is the largest, best grown, and most vigorous of
the old yews because it has not been mutilated at its
roots as the others have been?
</p>

<p>
There is but one grave beneath or near this tree;
not the grave of any important person, but a
nameless green mound of some obscure peasant.  I had
often looked with a feeling almost of astonishment
at that solitary conspicuous mound in such a place,
midway between the trunk of the tree and the
church door, wondering who it was whose poor
remains had been so honoured, and why it was.
Then by chance I found out the whole story; but
it came to me in scraps, at different times and
places, and that is how I will give it to the reader,
in fragments, in the course of the following chapter.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The first part of the story of that Selborne
mound in a strange place was heard at
Wolmer Forest, over five years ago, during
my first prolonged visit to that spot.  I have often
been there since, and have stayed many days, but
a first impression of a place, as of a face, is always
the best, the brightest, the truest, and I wish to
describe Wolmer as I saw it then.
</p>

<p>
It struck me on that visit that the pleasure we
have in visible nature depends in a measure on
contrast and novelty.  Never is moist verdure so
refreshing and delightful to the eye as when we come to
it from brown heaths and grey barren downs and
uplands.  So, too, the greenness of the green earth
sharpens our pleasure in all stony and waste places;
trim flower gardens show us the beauty of thorns and
briars, and make us in love with desolation.  As in
light and shade, wet and dry, tempest and calm, so
the peculiar attractions of each scene and aspect of
nature are best "illustrated by their contraries."
</p>

<p>
I had, accordingly, the best preparation for a visit
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
to Wolmer by a few days' ramble in Alice Holt
Forest, with its endless oaks, and in the luxuriant
meadows and cool shady woods at Waverley Abbey.
It was a great change to Wolmer Forest.  Although
its soil is a "hungry, bare sand," it has long been
transformed from the naked heath of Gilbert White's
time to a vast unbroken plantation.  Looked upon from
some eminence it has a rough, dark aspect.  There are
no smooth summits and open pleasant places; all is
covered by the shaggy mantle of the pines.  But it
is nowhere gloomy, as pine woods are apt to be: the
trees are not big enough, on account of that hungry
sand in which they are rooted, or because they are
not yet very old.  The pines not being too high and
shady to keep the sun and air out, the old aboriginal
vegetation has not been killed: in most places the
ling forms a thick undergrowth, and looks green,
while outside of the forest, in the full glare of the
sun, it has a harsh, dry, dead appearance.
</p>

<p>
On account of this abundance of ling a strange and
lovely appearance is produced in some favourable
years, when the flowers are in great profusion and
all the plants blossom at one time.  That most
beautiful sight of the early spring, when the bloom of the
wild hyacinth forms a sheet of azure colour under the
woodland trees, is here repeated in July, but with
a difference of hue both in the trees above and in
the bloom beneath.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wolmer Forest
</span>
</p>

<p>
In May, Wolmer is comparatively flowerless, and
there is no bright colour, except that of the earth
itself in some naked spot.  The water of the sluggish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
boggy streamlets in the forest, tributaries of the
well-named Dead Water, takes a deep red or orange
hue from the colour of the soil.  The sand abounds
with ironstone, which in the mass is deep rust-red-
and purple-coloured.  When crushed and pulverised
by traffic and weather on the roads, it turns to a
vivid chrome yellow.  In the hot noonday sun the
straight road that runs through the forest appeared
like a yellow band or ribbon.  That was a curious and
novel picture, which I often had before me during
the excessively dry and windy weather in May&mdash;the
vast whity-blue, hot sky, without speck or stain of
cloud above, and the dark forest covering the earth,
cut through by that yellow zone, extending straight
away until it was lost in the hazy distance.  Even
stranger was the appearance when the wind blew
strongest and raised clouds of dust from the road,
which flew like fiery yellow vapours athwart the
black pines.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The "Selborne mob"
</span>
</p>

<p>
In a small house by the roadside in the middle of
the forest I found a temporary home.  My aged
landlady proved a great talker, and treated me to
a good deal of Hampshire dialect.  Her mind was
well stored with ancient memories.  At first I let
her ramble on without paying too much attention;
but at length, while speaking of the many little
ups and downs of her not uneventful life, she asked
me if I knew Selborne, and then informed me that
she was a native of that village, and that her family
had lived there for generations.  Her mother had
reached the age of eighty-six years; she had married
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
her third husband when over seventy.  By her first
she had had two and by her second thirteen children,
and my informant, who is now aged seventy-six, was
the last born.  This wonderful mother of hers, who
had survived three husbands, and whose memory
went back several years into the eighteenth century,
had remembered the Rev. Gilbert White very well:
she was aged about twelve when he died.  It was
wonderful, she said, how many interesting things she
used to tell about him; for Gilbert White, whose
name was known to the great world outside of his
parish, was often in her mind when she recalled her
early years.  Unfortunately, these interesting things
had now all slipped out of my landlady's memory.
Whenever I brought her to the point she would stand
with eyes cast down, the fingers of her right hand
on her forehead, trying&mdash;trying to recall something
to tell me: a simple creature, who was without
imagination, and could invent nothing.  Then little
by little she would drift off into something else&mdash;to
recollections of people and events not so remote
in time, scenes she had witnessed herself, and which
had made a deeper impression on her mind.  One
was how her father, her mother's second husband,
had acted as horn-blower to the "Selborne mob,"
when the poor villagers were starving; and how,
blowing on his horn, he had assembled his
fellow-revolutionists, and led them to an attack on the
poorhouse, where they broke down the doors and
made a bonfire of the furniture; then on to the
neighbouring village of Headley to get recruits for their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
little army.  Then the soldiery arrived on the scene,
and took them prisoners and sent them to Winchester,
where they were tried by some little unremembered
Judge Jeffreys, who sentenced many or most of
them to transportation; but not the horn-blower,
who had escaped, and was in hiding among the
beeches of the famous Selborne Hanger.  Only at
midnight he would steal down into the village to get
a bite of food and hear the news from his vigorous
and vigilant wife.  At length, during one of these
midnight descents, he was seen, and captured, and
sent to Winchester.  But by this time the authorities
had grown sick&mdash;possibly ashamed&mdash;of dealing so
harshly with a few poor peasants, whose
sufferings had made them mad, and the horn-blower
was pardoned, and died in bed at home when his
time came.
</p>

<p>
I did not cease questioning the poor woman, because
she would not admit that all she had heard about
Gilbert White was gone past recall.  Often and often
had she thought of what her mother had told her.
Up to within two or three years ago she remembered
it all so well.  What was it now?  Once more, standing
dejected in the middle of the room, she would
cudgel her old brains.  So much had happened since
she was a girl.  She had been brought up to farm-work.
Here would follow the names of various farms
in the parishes of Selborne, Newton Valence, and
Oakhanger, where she had worked, mostly in the fields;
and of the farmers, long dead and gone most of them,
who had employed her.  All her life she had worked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
hard, struggling to live.  When people complained
of hard times now, of the little that was paid them
for their work, she and her husband remembered
what it was thirty and forty and fifty years ago, and
they wondered what people really wanted.  Cheap
food, cheap clothing, cheap education for the
children&mdash;everything was cheap now, and the pay more.
And she had had so many children to bring up&mdash;ten;
and seven of them were married, and were
now having so many children of their own that she
could hardly keep count of them.
</p>

<p>
It was idle to listen; and at last, in desperation,
I would jump up and rush out, for the wind was
calling in the pines, and the birds were calling, and
what they had to tell was just then of more interest
than any human story.
</p>

<p>
Not far from my cottage there was a hill, from the
summit of which the whole area of the forest was
visible, and the country all round for many leagues
beyond it.  I did not like this hill, and refused to
pay it a second visit.  The extent of country it
revealed made the forest appear too small; it spoilt
the illusion of a practically endless wilderness, where
I could stroll about all day and see no cultivated
spot, and no house, and perhaps no human form.
It was, moreover, positively disagreeable to be
stared at across the ocean of pines by a big,
brand-new, red-brick mansion, standing conspicuous,
unashamed, affronting nature, on some wide heath or
lonely hillside.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hollywater Clump
</span>
</p>

<p>
A second hill, not far from the first, was preferable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
when I wished for a wide horizon, or to drink the
wind and the music of the wind.  Round and dome-like,
it stood alone; and although not so high as
its neighbour, it was more conspicuous, and seen
from a distance appeared to be vastly higher.  The
reason of this was that it was crowned with a grove
of Scotch firs with boles that rose straight and smooth
and mast-like to a height of about eighty feet; thus,
seen from afar, the hill looked about a hundred feet
higher than it actually was, the tree-tops themselves
forming a thick, round dome, conspicuous above the
surrounding forest, and Wolmer's most prominent
feature.  I have often said of Hampshire&mdash;very many
persons have said the same&mdash;that it lacks one
thing&mdash;sublimity, or, let us say, grandeur.  I have been
over all its high, open down country, and upon all its
highest hills, which, although rising to a thousand
feet above the sea at one point, yet do not impress
one so much as the South Downs; and I have been
in all its forest lands, which have wildness and a
thousand beauties, and one asks for nothing better.
But the Hollywater Clump in Wolmer Forest as soon
as I come in sight of it wakes in me another sense
and feeling; and I have found in conversation with
others on this subject that they are affected in the
same way.  I doubt if anyone can fail to experience
such a feeling when looking on that great hill-top
grove, a stupendous pillared temple, with its
dome-like black roof against the sky, standing high
above and dominating the sombre pine and heath
country for miles around.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Bird life in the forest
</span>
</p>

<p>
Gilbert White described Wolmer as a naked heath
with very few trees growing on it.  The Hollywater
Clump must, one cannot but think, have been planted
before or during his time.  One old native of Wolmer,
whose memory over five years ago went back about
sixty years, assured me that the trees looked just as
big when he was a little boy as they do now.
Undoubtedly they are very old, and many, we see, are
decaying, and some are dead, and for many years
past they have been dying and falling.
</p>

<p>
The green woodpecker had discovered the unsoundness
of many of them; in some of the trunks, in their
higher part, the birds had made several holes.  These
were in line, one above the other, like stops in a
flute.  Most of these far-up houses or flats were
tenanted by starlings.  This was only too apparent
for the starling, although neat and glossy in his dress
is an untidy tenant, and smears the trunk beneath
the entrance to his nest with numberless droppings.
You might fancy that he had set himself to whitewash
his tenement, and had carelessly capsized his
little bucket of lime on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
It was pleasant in the late afternoon to sit at the
feet of these stately red columns&mdash;this brave
company of trees, that are warred against by all the
winds of heaven&mdash;and look upon the black legions
of the forest covering the earth beneath them for
miles.  High up in the swaying, singing tops a kind
of musical talk was audible&mdash;the starlings' medley
of clinking, chattering, wood-sawing, knife-grinding,
whistling, and bell-like sounds.  Higher still, above
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
the tree-tops, the jackdaws were at their aerial
gambols, calling to one another, exulting in the
wind.  They were not breeding there, but were
attracted to the spot by the height of the hill, with
its crown of soaring trees.  Some strong-flying
birds&mdash;buzzards, kites, vultures, gulls, and many
others&mdash;love to take their exercise far from earth, making
a playground of the vast void heaven.  The wind-loving
jackdaw, even in his freest, gladdest moments,
never wholly breaks away from the earth, and for
a playground prefers some high, steep place&mdash;a hill,
cliff, spire, or tower&mdash;where he can perch at intervals,
and from which he can launch himself, as the impulse
takes him, either to soar and float above, or to cast
himself down into the airy gulf below.
</p>

<p>
Stray herons, too, come to the trees to roost.  The
great bird could be seen far off, battling with the
wind, rising and falling, blown to this side and that,
now displaying his pale under-surface, and now the
slaty blue of his broad, slow-flapping wings.
</p>

<p>
As the sun sank nearer to the horizon, the tall
trunks would catch the level beams and shine like
fiery pillars, and the roof thus upheld would look
darker and gloomier by contrast.  With the passing
of that red light, the lively bird-notes would cease,
the trees would give forth a more solemn, sea-like
sound, and the day would end.
</p>

<p>
My days, during all the time I spent at Wolmer,
when I had given up asking questions, and my poor
old woman had ceased cudgelling her brains for lost
memories, were spent with the birds.  The yaffle,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
nightjar, and turtle-dove were the most characteristic
species.  Wolmer is indeed the metropolis of the
turtle-doves, even as Savernake is (or was) that of
the jays and jackdaws.  All day long the woods were
full of the low, pleasing sound of their cooing: as
one walked among the pines they constantly rose up
in small flocks from the ground with noisy wines
and as they flew out into some open space to vanish
again in the dark foliage, their wings in the strong
sunlight often looked white as silver.  But the only
native species I wish to speak of is the teal as I
found it a little over five years ago.  In Wolmer these
pretty entertaining little ducks have bred uninterruptedly
for centuries, but I greatly fear that the
changes now in progress&mdash;the increase of the
population, building, the large number of troops kept
close by, and perhaps, too, the slow drying up of
the marshy pools&mdash;will cause them to forsake their
ancient haunts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Teal
</span>
</p>

<p>
By chance I very soon discovered their choicest
breeding-place, not far from that dome-shaped,
fir-crowned hill which was my principal landmark.  This
was a boggy place, thirty or forty acres in extent
surrounded by trees and overgrown with marsh
weeds and grasses, and in places with rushes.  Cotton
grass grew in the drier parts, and the tufts nodding
in the wind looked at a distance like silvery white
flowers.  At one end of the marsh there were clumps
of willow and alder, where the reed-bunting was
breeding and the grasshopper warbler uttered his
continuous whirring sound, which seemed to accord
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
with the singing of the wind in the pines.  At the
other end there was open water with patches of rushes
growing in it; and here at the water's edge, shaded
by a small fir, I composed myself on a bed of heather
to watch the birds.
</p>

<p>
The inquisitive moor-hens were the first to appear,
uttering from time to time their sharp, loud protest.
Their suspicion lessened by degrees, but was never
wholly laid aside; and one bird, slyly leaving the
water, made a wide circuit and approached me
through the trees in order to get a better view of
me.  A sudden movement on my part, when he was
only three yards from me, gave him a terrible fright.
Mallards showed themselves at intervals, swimming
into the open water, or rising a few yards above the
rushes, then dropping out of sight again.  Where the
rushes grew thin and scattered, ducklings appeared,
swimming one behind the other, busily engaged in
snatching insects from the surface.  By-and-by a
pair of teal rose up, flew straight towards me, and
dropped into the open water within eighteen yards of
where I sat.  They were greatly excited, and no sooner
touched the water than they began calling loudly;
then, from various points, others rose and hurried to
join them, and in a few moments there were eleven,
all disporting themselves on the water at that short
distance.  Teal are always tamer than ducks of other
kinds, but the tameness of these Wolmer birds was
astonishing and very delightful.  For a few moments
I imagined they were excited at my presence, but it
very soon appeared that they were entirely absorbed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
in their own affairs and cared nothing about me.
What a wonderfully lively, passionate, variable, and
even ridiculous little creature the teal is!  Compared
with his great relations&mdash;swans, geese, and the bigger
ducks&mdash;he is like a monkey or squirrel among stately
bovine animals.  Now the teal have a world-wide
range, being found in all climates, and are of many
species; they are, moreover, variable in plumage,
some species having an exceedingly rich and
beautiful colouring; but wherever found, and however
different in colour, they are much the same in
disposition&mdash;they are loquacious, excitable, violent
in their affections beyond other ducks, and, albeit
highly intelligent, more fearless than other birds
habitually persecuted by man.  A sedate teal is
as rare as a sober-coloured humming-bird.  The teal
is also of so social a temper that even in the height
of the breeding season he is accustomed to meet his
fellows at little gatherings.  A curious thing is that
at these meetings they do not, like most social birds,
fall into one mind, and comport themselves in an
orderly, disciplined manner, all being moved by
one contagious impulse.  On the contrary, each bird
appears to have an impulse of his own, and to follow
it without regard to what his fellows may be doing.
One must have his bath, another his frolic; one falls
to courting, another to quarrelling, or even fighting,
and so on, and the result is a lively splashing,
confused performance, which is amusing to see.  It was
an exhibition of this kind which I was so fortunate
as to witness at the Wolmer pond.  The body-jerking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
antics and rich, varied plumage of the drakes gave
them a singular as well as a beautiful appearance;
and as they dashed and splashed about, sometimes
not more than fourteen yards from me, their motions
were accompanied by all the cries and calls they
have&mdash;their loud call, which is a bright and lively
sound; chatterings and little, sharp, exclamatory
notes; a long trill, somewhat metallic or bell-like;
and a sharp, nasal cry, rapidly reiterated several
times, like a laugh.
</p>

<p>
After they had worked off their excitement and
finished their fun they broke up into pairs and threes,
and went off in various directions, and I saw no more
of them.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the sun had set that a snipe
appeared.  First one rose from the marsh and began
to play over it in the usual manner, then another
rose to keep him company, and finally a third.
Most of the time they hovered with their breasts
towards me, and seen through my glass against the
pale luminous sky, their round, stout bodies, long
bills, and short, rapidly vibrating wings, gave
them the appearance of gigantic insects rather
than birds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Boys in the forest
</span>
</p>

<p>
At length, tired of watching them, I stretched
myself out in the ling, but continued listening, and
while thus occupied an amusing incident occurred.
A flock of eighteen mallards rose up with a startled
cry from the marsh at a distance, and after flying
once or twice round, dropped down again.  Then the
sound of crackling branches and of voices talking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
became audible advancing round the marsh towards
me.  It was the first human sound I had heard that
day at that spot.  Then the sounds ceased, and after
a couple of minutes of silence I glanced round in
the direction they had proceeded from, and beheld
a curious sight.  Three boys, one about twelve years
old, the others smaller, were grouped together on
the edge of the pool, gazing fixedly across the water
at me.  They had taken me for a corpse, or an escaped
criminal, or some such dreadful object, lying there
in the depth of the forest.  The biggest boy had
dropped on to one knee among the rough heather,
while the others, standing on either side, were
resting their hands on his shoulders.  Seen thus, in
their loose, threadbare, grey clothes and caps, struck
motionless, their white, scared faces, parted lips, and
wildly staring eyes turned to me, they were like a
group cut in stone.  I laughed and waved my hand
to them, whereupon their faces relaxed, and they
immediately dropped into natural attitudes.  Very
soon they moved away among the trees, but after
eight or ten minutes they reappeared near me, and
finally, from motives of curiosity, came uninvited to
my side.  They proved to be very good specimens
of the boy naturalist; thorough little outlaws, with
keen senses, and the passion for wildness strong in
them.  They told me that when they went bird-nesting
they made a day of it, taking bread and cheese
in their pockets, and not returning till the evening.
For an hour we talked in the fading light of day on
the wild creatures in the forest, until we could no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
longer endure the cloud of gnats that had gathered
round us.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
About three years after the visit to Wolmer I
made the acquaintance of a native of Selborne,
whose father had taken part as a lad in the famous
"Selborne mob," and who confirmed the story I
had heard about the horn-blower, whose name was
Newland.  He had been a soldier in his early
manhood before he returned to his native village and
married the widow who bore him so many children.
It was quite true that he had died at home, in bed,
and what was more, he added, he was buried just
between the church porch and the yew, where he was
all by himself.  How he came to be buried there he
did not know.
</p>

<p>
Lately, in October 1902, I heard the finish of the
story.  I found an old woman, a widow named
Garnett, an elder sister of the woman at Wolmer
Forest.  She is eighty years old, but was not born
until a year or two after the "Selborne mob" events,
which fixes the date of that outbreak about the
year 1820.  She has a brother, now in a workhouse,
about two years older than herself, who was a babe
in arms at that time.  When Newland was at last
captured and sent to Winchester, his poor wife, with
her baby in her arms, set out on foot to visit him in
gaol.  It was a long tramp for her thus burdened, and
it was also in the depth of one of the coldest winters
ever known.  She started early, but did not get to
her destination until the following morning, and not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
without suffering a fresh misfortune by the way.
Before dawn, when the cold was most intense, while
walking over Winchester Hill, her baby's nose was
frozen; and though everything proper was done
when she arrived at the houses, it never got quite
right.  His injured nose, which turns to a dark-blue
colour and causes him great suffering in cold weather,
has been a trouble and misery to him all his life long.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Story of the horn-blower
</span>
</p>

<p>
Newland, we know, was forgiven and returned to
spend the rest of his life in his village, where he died
at last of sheer old age, passing very quietly away
after receiving the sacrament from the vicar, and in
the presence of his faithful old wife and his children
and grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
After he was dead, two of his children&mdash;my informant,
and that brother who as a babe had travelled
to Winchester in his mother's arms in cold weather&mdash;talked
together about him and his life, and of all he
had suffered and of his goodness, and in both their
minds there was one idea, an anxious wish that his
descendants should not allow him to go out of memory.
And there was no way known to them to keep him
in mind except by burying him in some spot by
himself, where his mound would be alone and apart.
Finally, brother and sister, plucking up courage,
went to the vicar, the well-remembered Mr. Parsons,
who built the new vicarage and the church school,
and begged him to let them bury their father by the
yew tree near the porch, and he good-naturedly
consented.
</p>

<p>
That was how Newland came to be buried at that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
spot; but before many days the vicar went to them
in a great state of mind, and said that he had made a
terrible mistake, that he had done wrong in consenting
to the grave being made there, and that their
father must be taken up and placed at some other
spot in the churchyard.  They were grieved at this,
but could say nothing.  But for some reason the
removal never took place, and in time the son and
daughter themselves began to regret that they had
buried their father there where they could never
keep the mound green and fresh.  People going in
or coming out of church on dark evenings stumbled
or kicked their boots against it, or when they stood
there talking to each other they would rest a foot on
it, and romping children sat on it, so that it always
had a ragged, unkept appearance, do what they would.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly an unsightly mound.  It would be
better to do away with it, and to substitute a small
memorial stone with a suitable inscription placed
level with the turf.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The history of the horn-blower and his old
wife, and their still living aged children, serves
to remind me that this book, which contains
so much about all sorts of creatures and forms
of life, from spiders and flies to birds and beasts,
and from red alga on gravestones to oaks and yews,
has so far had almost nothing to say about our own
species&mdash;of that variety which inhabits Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Racial differences
</span>
</p>

<p>
If the critical reader asks what is here meant by
"variety," what should I answer him?  On going
directly from any other district in southern
England to the central parts of Hampshire one is sensible
of a difference in the people.  One is still in southern
England, and the peasantry, like the atmosphere,
climate, soil, the quiet but verdurous and varied
scenery, are more or less like those of other
neighbouring counties&mdash;Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Berkshire,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
Wilts, and Dorset.  In general appearance, at all
events, the people are much the same; and the
dialect, where any survives, and even the quality
of the voices, closely resemble those in adjoining
counties.  Nevertheless there is a difference; even the
hasty seers who are almost without the faculty of
observation are vaguely cognisant of it, though they
would not be able to say what it consisted in.
Probably it would puzzle anyone to say wherein
Hampshire differed from all the counties named, since
each has something individual; therefore it would
be better to compare Hampshire with some one
county near it, or with a group of neighbouring
counties in which some family resemblance is
traceable.  Somerset, Devon, Wilts, and Dorset&mdash;these
answer the description, and I leave out Cornwall
only because its people are unknown to me.  The four
named have seemed to me the most interesting
counties in southern England; but if I were to
make them five by adding Hampshire, the verdict
of nine persons out of ten, all equally well acquainted
with the five, would probably be that it was the least
interesting.  They would probably say that the people
of Hampshire were less good-looking, that they had
less red colour in their skins, less pure colour in their
eyes; that they had less energy, if not less
intelligence, or at all events were less lively, and had
less humour.
</p>

<p>
These differences between the inhabitants of
neighbouring and of adjoining counties are doubtless in
some measure due to local conditions, of soil, climate,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
food, customs, and so on, acting for long generations
on a stay-at-home people: but the main differences
are undoubtedly racial; and here we are on a subject
in which we poor ordinary folk who want to know
are like sheep wandering shepherdless in some
wilderness, bleating in vain for guidance in a maze of
fleece-tearing brambles.  It is true that the
ethnologists and anthropologists triumphantly point out
that the Jute type of man may be recognised in the
Isle of Wight, and in a less degree even in the Meon
district; for the rest, with a wave of the hand to
indicate the northern half of the county, they say
that all that is or ought to be more or less Anglo-Saxon.
That's all; since, as they tell us, the affinities
of the South Hampshire people, of the New Forest
district especially, have not yet been worked out.
Not being an anthropologist I can't help them; and
am even inclined to think that they have left undone
some of the things which they ought to have done.
The complaint was made in a former chapter that
we had no monograph on fleas to help us; it may
be made, too, with regard to the human race in
Hampshire.  The most that one can do in such a
case, since man cannot be excluded from the subjects
which concern the naturalist, is to record one's own
poor little unscientific observations, and let them go
for what they are worth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Gentry and peasantry
</span>
</p>

<p>
There is little profit in looking at the townspeople.
The big coast towns have a population quite as
heterogeneous as that of the metropolis; even in a
comparatively small rural inland town, like Winchester,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
one would be puzzled to say what the chief characteristics
of the people were.  You may feel in a vague
way that they are unlike the people of, say,
Guildford, or Canterbury, or Reading, or Dorchester,
but the variety in forms and faces is too great to
allow of any definite idea.  The only time when the
people even in a town can be studied to advantage
in places like Winchester, Andover, etc., is on a
market day, or on a Saturday afternoon, when the
villagers come in to do their marketing.  I have said,
in writing of Somerset and its people, that the gentry,
the landowners, and the wealthy residents generally,
are always in a sense foreigners.  The man may bear
a name which has been for many generations in a
county, but he is never racially one with the peasant;
and, as John Bright once said, it is the people who
live in cottages that make the nation.  His parents
and his grandparents and his ancestors for centuries
have been mixing their blood with the blood of
outsiders.  It is well always to bear this in mind, and
in the market-place or the High Street of the country
town to see the carriage people, the gentry, and the
important ones generally as though one saw them
not, or saw them as shadows, and to fix the
attention on those who in face and carriage and dress
proclaim themselves true natives and children of
the soil.
</p>

<p>
Even so there will be variety enough&mdash;a little
more perhaps than is wanted by the methodic mind
anxious to classify these "insect tribes."  But after
a time&mdash;a few months or a few years, let us
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
say&mdash;the observer will perceive that the majority of the
people are divisible into four fairly distinct types,
the minority being composed of intermediate forms
and of nondescripts.  There is an enormous disproportion
in the actual numbers of the people of these
distinct types, and it varies greatly in different parts
of the county.  Of the Hampshire people it may be
said generally, as we say of the whole nation, that
there are two types&mdash;the blonde and the dark; but
in this part of England there are districts where a
larger proportion of dark blood than is common in
England generally has produced a well-marked
intermediate type; and this is one of my four distinct
Hampshire types.  I should place it second in
importance, although it comes a very long way after the
first type, which is distinctly blonde.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Common blonde type
</span>
</p>

<p>
This first most prevalent type, which greatly
outnumbers all the others put together, and probably
includes more than half of the entire population, is
strongest in the north, and extends across the county
from Sussex to Wiltshire.  The Hampshire people in
that district are hardly to be distinguished from those
of Berkshire.  One can see this best by looking at
the school-children in a number of North Hampshire
and Berkshire villages.  In sixty or seventy to a
hundred and fifty children in a village school you
will seldom find as many as a dozen with dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
As was said in a former chapter, there is very little
beauty or good looks in this people; on the other
hand, there is just as little downright ugliness; they
are mostly on a rather monotonous level, just
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
passable in form and features, but with an almost entire
absence of any brightness, physical or mental.  Take
the best-looking woman of this most common type&mdash;the
description will fit a dozen in any village.  She
is of medium height, and has a slightly oval face
(which, being Anglo-Saxon, she ought not to have),
with fairly good features; a nose fairly straight, or
slightly aquiline, and not small; mouth well moulded,
but the lips too thin; chin frequently pointed.  Her
hair is invariably brown, without any red or chestnut
colour in it, generally of a dull or dusty hue;
and the eyes are a pale greyish-blue, with small
pupils, and in very many cases a dark mark round
the iris.  The deep blue, any pure blue, in fact, from
forget-me-not to ultramarine, is as rare in this
commonest type as warm or bright hair&mdash;chestnut,
red, or gold; or as a brilliant skin.  The skin is
pallid, or dusky, or dirty-looking.  Even healthy
girls in their teens seldom have any colour, and the
exquisite roseate and carmine reds of other counties
are rare indeed.  The best-looking girls at the time of
life when they come nearest to being pretty, when
they are just growing into womanhood, have an
unfinished look which is almost pathetic.  One gets
the fancy that Nature had meant to make them
nice-looking, and finally becoming dissatisfied with
her work, left them to grow to maturity anyhow.
It is pathetic, because there was little more to be
done&mdash;a rosier blush on the cheek, a touch of scarlet
on the lips, a little brightness and elasticity in the
hair, a pencil of sunlight to make the eyes sparkle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
</p>

<p>
In figure this woman is slim, too narrow across
the hips, too flat in the chest.  And she grows thinner
with years.  The number of lean, pale women of
this type in Hampshire is very remarkable.  You see
them in every village, women that appear almost
fleshless, with a parchment-like skin drawn tight
over the bones of the face, pale-blue, washed-out
eyes, and thin, dead-looking hair.  What is the
reason of this leanness?  It may be that the women
of this blonde type are more subject to poverty of
blood than others; for the men, though often thin,
are not so excessively thin as the women.  Or it may
be the effect of that kind of poison which cottage
women all over the country are becoming increasingly
fond of, and which is having so deleterious an
effect on the people in many counties&mdash;the tea they
drink.  Poison it certainly is: two or three cups a
day of the black juice which they obtain by boiling
and brewing the coarse Indian teas at a shilling a
pound which they use, would kill me in less than
a week.
</p>

<p>
Or it may be partly the poison of tea and partly
the bad conditions, especially the want of proper
food, in the villages.  One day on the downs near
Winchester I found a shepherd with his flock, a man
of about fifty, and as healthy and strong-looking a
fellow as I have seen in Hampshire.  Why was it,
I asked him, that he was the only man of his village
I had seen with the colour of red blood in his
face? why did they look so unwholesome generally? why
were the women so thin, and the children so stunted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
and colourless?  He said he didn't know, but thought
that for one thing they did not get enough to eat.
"On the farm where I work," he said, "there are
twelve of us&mdash;nine men, all married, and three boys.
My wages are thirteen shillings, with a cottage and
garden; I have no children, and I neither drink nor
smoke, and have not done so for eighteen years.
Yet I find the money is not too much.  Of the others,
the eight married men all have children&mdash;one has
got six at home: they all smoke, and all make a
practice of spending at least two evenings each
week at the public-house."  How, after paying for
beer and tobacco, they could support their families
on the few shillings that remained out of their wages
was a puzzle to him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A mixed race
</span>
</p>

<p>
But this is to digress.  The prevalent blonde type
I have tried to describe is best seen in the northern
half of the county, but is not so accentuated on
the east, north, and west borders as in the interior
villages.  If, as is commonly said, this people is
Anglo-Saxon, it must at some early period have
mixed its blood with that of a distinctly different
race.  This may have been the Belgic or Brythonic,
but as shape and face are neither Celtic nor Saxon,
the Brythons must have already been greatly
modified by some older and different race which they,
or the Goidels before them, had conquered and
absorbed.  It will be necessary to return to this
point by-and-by.
</p>

<p>
Side by side with this, in a sense, dim and doubtful
people, you find the unmistakable Saxon, the thick-set,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
heavy-looking, round-headed man with blue eyes
and light hair, and heavy drooping mustachios&mdash;a
sort of terrestrial walrus who goes erect.  He is not
abundant as in Sussex, but is represented in almost
any village, and in these villages he is always like a
bull-dog or bull-terrier among hounds, lurchers, and
many other varieties, including curs of low degree.
Mentally, he is rather a dull dog, at all events deficient
in the finer, more attractive qualities.  Leaving aside
the spiritual part, he is a good all-round man, tough
and stubborn, one that the naturalist may have no
secret qualms about in treating as an animal.  A
being of strong animal nature, and too often in this
brewer-ridden county a hard drinker.  A very large
proportion of the men in rural towns and villages with
blotchy skins and watery or beery eyes are of this type.
Even more offensive than the animality, the mindlessness,
is that flicker of conscious superiority which
lives in their expression.  It is, I fancy, a survival
of the old instinctive feeling of a conquering race
amid the conquered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Reversion of type
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nature, we know, is everlastingly harking back,
but here in Hampshire I cannot but think that this
type, in spite of its very marked characters, is a
very much muddied and degenerate form.  One is
led to this conclusion by occasionally meeting with
an individual whose whole appearance is a
revelation, and strikes the mind with a kind of
astonishment, and one can only exclaim&mdash;there is nothing
else to say&mdash;Here Nature has at length succeeded in
reproducing the pure unadulterated form!  Such a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
type I came upon one summer day on the high downs
east of the Itchen.
</p>

<p>
He was a shepherd, a young fellow of twenty,
about five feet eight in height, but looking short on
account of his extraordinary breadth of shoulders
and depth of chest.  His arms were like a
blacksmith's, and his legs thick, and his big head was
round as a Dutch cheese.  He could, I imagined,
have made a breach in the stone wall near which
I found him with his flock, if he had lowered that
hard round head and charged like a rhinoceros.  His
hair was light brown, and his face a uniform rosy
brown&mdash;in all Hampshire no man nor woman had
I seen so beautiful in colour; and his round, keen,
piercing eyes were of a wonderful blue&mdash;"eyes like
the sea."  If this poor fellow, washed clean and
clothed becomingly in white flannels, had shown
himself in some great gathering at the Oval or some
such place on some great day, the common people
would have parted on either side to make way for
him, and would have regarded him with a kind of
worship&mdash;an impulse to kneel before him.  There,
on the downs, his appearance was almost grotesque
in the dress he wore, made of some fabric intended
to last for ever, but now frayed, worn to threads in
places, and generally earth-coloured.  A small old
cap, earth-coloured too, covered a portion of his
big, round head, and his ancient, lumpish, cracked
and clouted boots were like the hoofs of some extinct
large sort of horse which he had found fossilised
among the chalk hills.  He had but eleven shillings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
a week, and could not afford to spend much on dress.
How he could get enough to eat was a puzzle; he
looked as if he could devour half of one of his muttons
at a meal, washed down with a bucket of beer,
without hurt to his digestion.  In appearance he formed
a startling contrast to the people around him: they
were in comparison a worn-out, weary-looking race,
dim-eyed, pale-faced, slow in their movements, as
if they had lost all joy and interest in life.
</p>

<p>
The sight of him taught me something I could not
get from the books.  The intensity of life in his eyes
and whole expression; the rough-hewn face and rude,
powerful form&mdash;rude but well balanced&mdash;the vigour
in his every movement, enabled me to realise better
than anything that history tells us what those men
who came as strangers to these shores in the fifth
century were really like, and how they could do
what they did.  They came, a few at a time, in open
row-boats, with nothing but their rude weapons in
their hands, and by pure muscular force, and because
they were absolutely without fear and without
compassion, and were mentally but little above a herd
of buffaloes, they succeeded in conquering a great
and populous country with centuries of civilisation
behind it.
</p>

<p>
Talking with him, I was not surprised to find him
a discontented man.  He did not want to live in a
town&mdash;he seemed not to know just what he wanted,
or having but few words he did not know how to
say it; but his mind was in a state of turmoil and
revolt, and he could only curse the head shepherd,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
the bailiff, the farmer, and, to finish up, the lord of
the manor.  Probably he soon cast away his crook,
and went off in search of some distant place, where
he would be permitted to discharge the energy that
seethed and bubbled in him&mdash;perhaps to bite the
dust on the African veldt.
</p>

<p>
This, then, is one of the main facts to be noted in
the blonde Hampshire peasant&mdash;the great contrast
between the small minority of persons of the
Anglo-Saxon and of the prevalent type.  It was long ago
shown by Huxley that the English people generally
are not Saxons in the shape of the head, and in all
Saxon England the divergence has perhaps been
greatest in this southern county.  The oval-faced
type, as I have said, is less pronounced as we approach
the borders of Berkshire, and although the difference
is not very great, it is quite perceptible; the
Berkshire people are rather nearer to the common
modified Saxon type of Oxfordshire and the Midlands
generally.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dark Hampshire people
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the southern half of Hampshire the dark-eyed,
black-haired people are almost as common as the
blonde, and in some localities they are actually in a
majority.  Visitors to the New Forest district often
express astonishment at the darkness and "foreign"
appearance of the people, and they sometimes form
the mistaken idea that it is due to a strong element
of gipsy blood.  The darkest Hampshire peasant is
always in shape of head and face the farthest removed
from the gipsy type.
</p>

<p>
Among the dark people there are two distinct
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
types, as there are two in the blonde, and it will
be understood that I only mean two that are, in a
measure, fixed and easily recognised types; for it
must always be borne in mind that, outside of these
distinctive forms, there is a heterogeneous crowd of
persons of all shades and shapes of face and of
great variety in features.  These two dark types are:
First, the small, narrow-headed person of brown
skin, crow-black hair, and black eyes; of this rarest
and most interesting type I shall speak last.  Second,
the person of average height, slightly oval face, and
dark eyes and hair.  The accompanying portrait of
a young woman in a village on the Test is a good
specimen of this type.  Now we find that this
dark-haired, dark-eyed, and often dark-skinned people
are in stature, figure, shape of head, and features
exactly like the oval-faced blonde people already
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
described.  They are, light and dark, an intermediate
type, and we can only say that they are one and the
same people, the outcome of a long-mixed race which
has crystallised in this form unlike any of its originals;
that the difference in colour is due to the fact that
blue and black in the iris and black and brown in
the hair very seldom mix, these colours being, as has
been said, "mutually exclusive."  They persist when
everything else, down to the bony framework, has
been modified and the original racial characters
obliterated.  Nevertheless, we see that these mutually
exclusive colours do mix in some individuals both in
the eyes and hair.  In the grey-blue iris it appears as
a very slight pigmentation, in most cases round the
pupil, but in the hair it is more marked.  Many,
perhaps a majority, of the dark-eyed people we are
now considering have some warm brown colour in
their black hair; in members of the same family you
will often find raven-black hair and brownish-black
hair; and sometimes in three brothers or sisters you
will find the two original colours, black and brown, and
the intermediate very dark or brownish-black hair.

<br />
A HAMPSHIRE GIRL
</p>

<p>
The brunette of this oval-faced type is also, as we
have seen, deficient in colour, but, as a rule, she is
more attractive than her light-eyed sister.  This may
be due to the appearance of a greater intensity of
life in the dark eye; but it is also probable that there
is almost always some difference in disposition, that
black or dark pigment is correlated with a warmer,
quicker, more sympathetic nature.  The anthropologists
tell us that very slight differences in intensity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
of pigmentation may correspond to relatively very
great constitutional differences.  One fact in reference
to dark- and light-coloured people which I came upon
in Hampshire, struck me as exceedingly curious, and
has suggested the question: Is there in us, or in some
of us, very deep down, and buried out of sight, but
still occasionally coming to life and to the surface,
an ancient feeling of repulsion or racial antipathy
between black and blonde?  Are there mental characteristics,
too, that are "mutually exclusive"?  Dark
and light are mixed in very many of us, but, as
Huxley has said, the constituents do not always rightly
mix: as a rule, one side is strongest.  With the dark
side strongest in me, I search myself, and the only
evidence I find of such a feeling is an ineradicable
dislike of the shallow frosty blue eye: it makes me
shiver, and seems to indicate a cold, petty, spiteful,
and false nature.  This may be merely a fancy or
association, the colour resembling that of the frosty
sky in winter.  In many others the feeling appears
to be more definite.  I know blue-eyed persons of
culture, liberal-minded, religious, charitable, lovers
of all men, who declare that they cannot regard
dark-eyed persons as being on the same level, morally,
with the blue-eyed, and that they cannot dissociate
black eyes from wickedness.  This, too, may be fancy
or association.  But here in Hampshire I have been
startled at some things I have heard spoken by
dark-eyed people about blondes.  Not of the mitigated
Hampshire blonde, with that dimness in the colour
of his skin, and eyes, and hair, but of the more vivid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
type with brighter blue eyes, and brighter or more
fiery hair, and the light skin to match.  What I have
heard was to this effect:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it will be all right in the end&mdash;we hope
it will: he says he will marry her and give her a
home.  But you never know where you are with a
man of that colour&mdash;I'll believe it when I see it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he seems all right, and speaks well, and
promises to pay the money.  But look at the colour
of his eyes!  No, I can't trust him."
</p>

<p>
"He's a very nice person, I have no doubt, but
his eyes and hair are enough for me," etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Even this may be merely the effect of that enmity
or suspicion with which the stranger, or "foreigner,"
as he is called, is often regarded in rural districts.
The person from another county, or from a distance,
unrelated to anyone in the community, is always
a foreigner, and the foreign taint may descend to
the children: may it not be that in Hampshire anyone
with bright colour in eyes, hair, and skin is also
by association regarded as a foreigner?
</p>

<p>
It remains to speak of the last of the four distinct
types, the least common and most interesting of
all&mdash;the small, narrow-headed man with very black
hair, black eyes, and brown skin.
</p>

<p>
We are deeply indebted to the anthropologists
who have, so to speak, torn up the books of history,
and are re-telling the story of man on earth: we
admire them for their patient industry, and because
they have gone bravely on with their self-appointed
task, one peculiarly difficult in this land of many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
mixed races, heedless of the scoffs of the learned or
of those who derive their learning from books alone,
and mock at men whose documents are "bones and
skins."  But we sometimes see that they (the
anthropologists) have not yet wholly emancipated
themselves from the old written falsehoods when they
tell us, as they frequently do, that the Iberian in
this country survives only in the west and the north.
They refer to the small, swarthy Welshman; to the
so-called "black Celt" in Ireland, west of the
Shannon; to the small black Yorkshireman of the Dales,
and to the small black Highlander; and the explanation
is that in these localities remnants of the dark
men of the Iberian race who inhabited Britain in the
Neolithic period, were never absorbed by the conquerors;
that, in fact, like the small existing herds
of indigenous white cattle, they have preserved
their peculiar physical character down to the present
time by remaining unmixed with the surrounding
blue-eyed people.  But this type is not confined to
these isolated spots in the west and north; it is
found here, there, and everywhere, especially in the
southern counties of England: you cannot go about
among the peasants of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and
Dorset without meeting examples of it, and here
at all events, it cannot be said that the ancient
British people were not absorbed.  They, the remnant
that escaped extermination, were absorbed by the
blue-eyed, broad-headed, tall men, the Goidels we
suppose, who occupied the country at the beginning
of the Bronze Age; and the absorbers were in their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
turn absorbed by another blue-eyed race; and these
by still another or by others.  The only explanation
appears to be that this type is persistent beyond
all others, and that a very little black blood, after
being mixed and re-mixed with blonde for centuries,
even for hundreds of generations, may, whenever
the right conditions occur, reproduce the vanished
type in its original form.
</p>

<p>
Time brings about its revenges in many strange
ways: we see that there is a continuous and an
increasing migration from Wales and the Highlands
into all the big towns in England, and this large
and growing Celtic element will undoubtedly have
a great effect on the population in time, making it
less Saxon and more Celtic than it has been these
thousand years past and upwards.  But in all the
people, Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Dane, or what not,
there is that older constituent&mdash;infinitely older and
perhaps infinitely more persistent; and this too,
albeit in a subtler way, may be working in us to
recover its long-lost world.  That it has gone far in
this direction in Spain, where the blue eye is
threatened with extinction, and in the greater portion,
if not all, of France, there appears to be some
evidence to show.  Here, where the Neolithic people were
more nearly exterminated and the remnant more
completely absorbed, the return may be very
much slower.  But when we find, as we do in
Hampshire and many other counties, that this
constituent in the blood of the people, after mixture for
untold ages with so many other bloods of so many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
conquering races, has not only been potent to modify
the entire population, but is able to reproduce the
old type in its pristine purity; and when we almost
invariably find that these ancients born again are
better men than those in whom other racial characters
predominate&mdash;more intelligent, versatile, adaptive,
temperate, and usually tougher and longer lived,
it becomes possible to believe that in the remote
future&mdash;there are thousands of years for this little
black leaven to work&mdash;these islands will once more be
inhabited by a race of men of the Neolithic type.
</p>

<p>
In speaking of the character, physical and mental,
of the men of distinctly Iberian type, I must confess
that I write only from my own observation, and that
I am hardly justified in founding general statements
on an acquaintance with a very limited number of
persons.  My experience is that the men of this type
have, generally speaking, more character than their
neighbours, and are certainly very much more
interesting.  In recalling individuals of the peasant
class who have most attracted me, with whom I
have become intimate and in some instances formed
lasting friendships, I find that of twenty-five to
thirty no fewer than nine are of this type.  Of this
number four are natives of Hampshire, while the
other five, oddly enough, belong to five different
counties.  But I do not judge only from these few
individuals: a rambler about the country who seldom
stays many days in one village or spot cannot become
intimately acquainted with the cottagers.  I judge
partly from the few I know well, and partly from a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
very much larger number of individuals I have met
casually or have known slightly.  What I am certain
of is that the men of this type, as a rule, differ
mentally as widely as they do physically from persons
of other commoner types.  The Iberian, as I know
him in southern and south-western England, is, as
I have said, more intelligent, or at all events, quicker;
his brains are nimbler although perhaps not so retentive
or so practical as the slower Saxon's.  Apart
from that point, he has more imagination,
detachment, sympathy&mdash;the qualities which attract and
make you glad to know a man and to form a friendship
with him in whatever class he may be.  Why is
it, one is sometimes asked, that one can often know
and talk with a Spaniard or Frenchman without any
feeling of class distinction, any consciousness of a
barrier, although the man may be nothing but a
workman, while with English peasants this freedom
and ease between man and man is impossible?  It
is possible in the case of the man we are
considering, simply because of those qualities I have
named, which he shares with those of his own race
on the Continent.
</p>

<p>
I have found that when one member of a family
of mixed light and dark blood is of the distinctly
Iberian type, this one will almost invariably take a
peculiar and in some ways a superior position in
the circle.  The woman especially exhibits a liveliness,
humour, and variety rare indeed among persons
born in the peasant class.  She entertains the visitor,
or takes the leading part, and her slow-witted sisters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
regard her with a kind of puzzled admiration.  They
are sisters, yet unrelated: their very blood differs
in specific gravity, and their bodily differences
correspond to a mental and spiritual unlikeness.  In
my intercourse with people in the southern counties
I have sometimes been reminded of Huxley and his
account of his parents contained in a private letter
to Havelock Ellis.  His father, he said, was a
fresh-coloured, grey-eyed Warwickshire man.  "My mother
came of Wiltshire people.  Except for being somewhat
taller than the average type, she was a typical
example of the Iberian variety&mdash;dark, thin, rapid in
all her ways, and with the most piercing black eyes
I have seen in anybody's head.  Mentally and physically
(except in the matter of the beautiful eyes) I
am a piece of my mother, and except for my stature
... I should do very well for a 'black Celt'&mdash;supposed
to be the worst variety of that type."
</p>

<p>
The contrast between persons of this type and
Saxon or blonde has often seemed to me greatest in
childhood, since the blonde at that period, even in
Hampshire, is apt to be a delicate pink and white
whereas the individual of strongly-marked Iberian
character is very dark from birth.  I will, to conclude
this perhaps imprudent chapter, give an instance
in point.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A dark village child
</span>
</p>

<p>
Walking one day through the small rustic village
of Martyr Worthy, near Winchester, I saw a little
girl of nine or ten sitting on the grass at the side of
the wide green roadway in the middle of the village
engaged in binding flowers round her hat.  She was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
slim, and had a thin oval face, dark in colour as any
dark Spanish child, or any French child in the "black
provinces"; and she had, too, the soft melancholy
black eye which is the chief beauty of the Spanish,
and her loose hair was intensely black.  Even here
where dark eyes and dark hair are so common, her
darkness was wonderful by contrast with a second
little girl of round, chubby, rosy face, pale-yellowish
hair, and wide-open blue surprised eyes, who stood
by her side watching her at her task.  The flowers
were lying in a heap at her side; she had wound a
long slender spray of traveller's joy round her brown
straw hat, and was now weaving in lychnis and
veronica, with other small red and blue blossoms,
to improve her garland.  I found to my surprise on
questioning her that she knew the names of the
flowers she had collected.  An English village
child, but in that Spanish darkness and beauty,
and in her grace and her pretty occupation, how
very un-English she seemed!

<p>
There are no more refreshing places in
Hampshire, one might almost say in England,
than the green level valleys of the Test and
Itchen that wind, alternately widening and narrowing,
through the downland country to Southampton
Water.  Twin rivers they may be called, flowing at
no great distance apart through the same kind of
country, and closely alike in their general features:
land and water intermixed&mdash;greenest water-meadows
and crystal currents that divide and subdivide and
join again, and again separate, forming many a
miniature island and long slip of wet meadow with
streams on either side.  At all times refreshing to
the sight and pleasant to dwell by, they are best
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When it is summer and the green is deep.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Greens of darkest bulrushes, tipped with bright
brown panicles, growing in masses where the water
is wide and shallowest; of grey-green graceful reeds
and of tallest reed-mace with dark velvety brown
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
spikes; behind them all, bushes and trees&mdash;silvery-leafed
willow and poplar, and dark alder, and old
thorns and brambles in tangled masses; and always
in the foreground lighter and brighter sedges, glaucous
green flags, mixed with great hemp agrimony, with
flesh-coloured, white-powdered flowers, and big-leafed
comfrey, and scores of other water and moisture-loving
plants.
</p>

<p>
Through this vegetation, this infinite variety of
refreshing greens and graceful forms, flow the rapid
rivers, crystal-clear and cold from the white chalk,
a most beautiful water, with floating water-grass in
it&mdash;the fascinating <i>Poa fluviatilis</i> which, rooted in
the pebbly bed, looks like green loosened wind-blown
hair swaying and trembling in the ever-crinkled,
swift current.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Test and Itchen
</span>
</p>

<p>
They are not long rivers&mdash;the Test and Itchen&mdash;but
long enough for men with unfevered blood in
their veins to find sweet and peaceful homes on their
margins.  I think I know quite a dozen villages on
the former stream, and fifteen or sixteen on the
latter, in any one of which I could spend long
years in perfect contentment.  There are towns, too,
ancient Romsey and Winchester, and modern hideous
Eastleigh; but the little centres are best to live in.
These are, indeed, among the most characteristic
Hampshire villages; mostly small, with old thatched
cottages, unlike, yet harmonising, irregularly placed
along the roadside; each with its lowly walls
set among gaily coloured flowers; the farm with
its rural sounds and smells, its big horses and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
milch-cows led and driven along the quiet streets;
the small ancient church with its low, square tower,
or grey shingled spire; and great trees standing singly
or in groups or rows&mdash;oak and elm and ash; and
often some ivy-grown relic of antiquity&mdash;ivy, indeed,
everywhere.  The charm of these villages that look
as natural and one with the scene as chalk down and
trees and green meadows, and have an air of
immemorial quiet and a human life that is part of
nature's life, unstrenuous, slow and sweet, has not
yet been greatly disturbed.  It is not here as in
some parts of Hampshire, and as it is pretty well
everywhere in Surrey, that most favoured county,
the Xanadu of the mighty ones of the money-market,
where they oftenest decree their lordly pleasure-domes.
Those vast red-brick habitations of the
Kubla Khans of the city which stare and glare at
you from all openings in pine woods, across wide
heaths and commons, and from hill-sides and
hill-tops, produce the idea that they were turned out
complete at some stupendous manufactory of houses
at a distance, and sent out by the hundred to be set
up wherever wanted, and where they are almost
always utterly out of keeping with their surroundings,
and consequently a blot on and a disfigurement
of the landscape.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Itchen Valley
</span>
</p>

<p>
Happily the downland slopes overlooking these
green valleys have so far been neglected by the class
of persons who live in mansions; for the time being
they are ours, and by "ours" I mean all those who
love and reverence this earth.  But which of the two
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
is best I cannot say.  One prefers the Test and another
the Itchen, doubtless because in a matter of this kind
the earth-lover will invariably prefer the spot he
knows most intimately; and for this reason, much
as I love the Test, long as I would linger by it, I
love the Itchen more, having had a closer intimacy
with it.  I dare say that some of my friends, old
Wykehamists, who as boys caught their first trout
close by the ancient sacred city and have kept up
their acquaintance with its crystal currents, will laugh
at me for writing as I do.  But there are places, as
there are faces, which draw the soul, and with which,
in a little while, one becomes strangely intimate.
</p>

<p>
The first English cathedral I ever saw was that of
Winchester: that was a long time ago; it was then
and on a few subsequent occasions that I had glimpses
of the river that runs by it.  They were like momentary
sights of a beautiful face, caught in passing, of
some person unknown.  Then it happened that in
June 1900, cycling Londonwards from Beaulieu and
the coast by Lymington, I came to the valley, and to
a village about half-way between Winchester and
Alresford, on a visit to friends in their summer
fishing retreat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A riverside cottage
</span>
</p>

<p>
They had told me about their cottage, which serves
them all the best purposes of a lodge in the vast
wilderness.  Fortunately in this case the "boundless
contiguity of shade" of the woods is some little
distance away, on the other side of the ever green
Itchen valley, which, narrowing at this spot, is not
much more than a couple of hundred yards wide.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
A long field's length away from the cottage is the
little ancient, rustic, tree-hidden village.  The cottage,
too, is pretty well hidden by trees, and has the reed-
and sedge- and grass-green valley and swift river
before it, and behind and on each side green fields
and old untrimmed hedges with a few old oak trees
growing both in the hedgerows and the fields.  There
is also an ancient avenue of limes which leads nowhere
and whose origin is forgotten.  The ground under
the trees is overgrown with long grass and nettles
and burdock; nobody comes or goes by it, it is
only used by the cattle, the white and roan and
strawberry shorthorns that graze in the fields and stand in
the shade of the limes on very hot days.  Nor is there
any way or path to the cottage; but one must go and
come over the green fields, wet or dry.  The avenue
ends just at the point where the gently sloping chalk
down touches the level valley, and the half-hidden,
low-roofed cottage stands just there, with the shadow
of the last two lime trees falling on it at one side.
It was an ideal spot for a nature-lover and an angler
to pitch his tent upon.  Here a small plot of ground,
including the end of the lime-tree avenue, was
marked out, a hedge of sweetbriar planted round
it, the cottage erected, and a green lawn made before
it on the river side, and beds of roses planted at
the back.
</p>

<p>
Nothing more&mdash;no gravel walks; no startling
scarlet geraniums, no lobelias, no cinerarias, no
calceolarias, nor other gardeners' abominations to hurt
one's eyes and make one's head ache.  And no dog,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
nor cat, nor chick, nor child&mdash;only the wild birds
to keep one company.  They knew how to appreciate
its shelter and solitariness; they were all about it,
and built their nests amid the great green masses of
ivy, honeysuckle, Virginia creeper, rose, and wild
clematis which covered the trellised walls and part
of the red roof with a twelve years' luxuriant growth.
To this delectable spot I returned on 21st July to
see the changeful summer of 1900 out, my friends
having gone north and left me their cottage for
a habitation.
</p>

<p>
"There is the wind on the heath, brother," and
one heartily agrees with the half-mythical Petulengro
that it is a very good thing; it had, indeed, been
blowing off and on in my face for many months
past; and from shadeless heaths and windy downs,
and last of all, from the intolerable heat and dusty
desolation of London in mid-July, it was a delightful
change to this valley.
</p>

<p>
During the very hot days that followed it was
pleasure enough to sit in the shade of the limes
most of the day; there was coolness, silence, melody,
fragrance; and, always before me, the sight of that
moist green valley, which made one cool simply to
look at it, and never wholly lost its novelty.  The
grass and herbage grow so luxuriantly in the
water-meadows that the cows grazing there were
half-hidden in their depth; and the green was tinged with
the purple of seeding grasses, and red of dock and
sorrel, and was everywhere splashed with creamy
white of meadow-sweet.  The channels of the swift
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
many-channelled river were fringed with the livelier
green of sedges and reed-mace, and darkest green of
bulrushes, and restful grey of reeds not yet in flower.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Bird visitors
</span>
</p>

<p>
The old limes were now in their fullest bloom; and
the hotter the day the greater the fragrance, the
flower, unlike the woodbine and sweetbriar, needing
no dew nor rain to bring out its deliciousness.  To me,
sitting there, it was at the same time a bath and
atmosphere of sweetness, but it was very much more
than that to all the honey-eating insects in the
neighbourhood.  Their murmur was loud all day till dark,
and from the lower branches that touched the grass
with leaf and flower to their very tops the trees were
peopled with tens and with hundreds of thousands
of bees.  Where they all came from was a mystery;
somewhere there should be a great harvest of honey
and wax as a result of all this noise and activity.  It
was a soothing noise, according with an idle man's
mood in the July weather; and it harmonised with,
forming, so to speak, an appropriate background
to, the various distinct and individual sounds of
bird life.
</p>

<p>
The birds were many, and the tree under which
I sat was their favourite resting-place; for not only
was it the largest of the limes, but it was the last of
the row, and overlooked the valley, so that when
they flew across from the wood on the other side
they mostly came to it.  It was a very noble tree,
eighteen feet in circumference near the ground; at
about twenty feet from the root, the trunk divided
into two central boles and several of lesser size, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
these all threw out long horizontal and drooping
branches, the lowest of which feathered down to the
grass.  One sat as in a vast pavilion, and looked up
to a height of sixty or seventy feet through wide
spaces of shadow and green sunlight, and sunlit
golden-green foliage and honey-coloured blossom,
contrasting with brown branches and with masses
of darkest mistletoe.
</p>

<p>
Among the constant succession of bird visitors to
the tree above me were the three pigeons&mdash;ring-dove,
stock-dove, and turtle-dove; finches, tree-warblers,
tits of four species, and the wren, tree-creeper,
nuthatch, and many more.  The best vocalists had
ceased singing; the last nightingale I had heard
utter its full song was in the oak woods of Beaulieu
on 27th June: and now all the tree-warblers, and
with them chaffinch, thrush, blackbird, and robin,
had become silent.  The wren was the leading
songster, beginning his bright music at four o'clock in
the morning, and the others, still in song, that
visited me were the greenfinch, goldfinch, swallow,
dunnock, and cirl bunting.  From my seat I could also
hear the songs in the valley of the reed and sedge
warblers, reed-bunting, and grasshopper-warbler.
These, and the polyglot starling, and cooing and
crooning doves, made the last days of July at this
spot seem not the silent season we are accustomed
to call it.
</p>

<p>
Of these singers the goldfinch was the most pleasing.
The bird that sang near me had assisted in rearing a
brood in a nest on a low branch a few yards away, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
he still returned from the fields at intervals to sing;
and seen, as I now saw him a dozen times a day,
perched among the lime leaves and blossoms at the
end of a slender bough, in his black and gold and
crimson livery, he was by far the prettiest of my
feathered visitors.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cirl bunting
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the cirl bunting, the inferior singer, interested
me most, for I am somewhat partial to the buntings,
and he is the best of them, and the one I knew least
about from personal observation.
</p>

<p>
On my way hither at the end of June, somewhere
between Romsey and Winchester, a cock cirl bunting
in fine plumage flew up before me and perched on
the wire of a roadside fence.  It was a welcome
encounter, and, alighting, I stood for some time
watching him.  I did not know that I was in a
district where this pretty species is more numerous
than in any other place in England&mdash;as common,
in fact, as the universal yellowhammer, and
commoner than the more local corn-bunting.  Here in
July and August, in the course of an afternoon's
walk, in any place where there are trees and grass
fields, one can count on hearing half a dozen birds
sing, every one of them probably the parent of a
nestful of young.  For this is the cirl bunting's
pleasant habit.  He assists in feeding and safeguarding
the young, even as other songsters do who cease
singing when this burden is laid upon them; but he
is a bird of placid disposition, and takes his task
more quietly than most; and, after returning from
the fields with several grasshoppers in his throat and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
beak and feeding his fledglings, he takes a rest, and
at intervals in the day flies to his favourite tree,
and repeats his blithe little song half a dozen times.
</p>

<p>
The song is not quite accurately described in the
standard ornithological works as exactly like that
of the yellowhammer, only without the thin,
drawn-out note at the end, and therefore inferior&mdash;the
little bit of bread, but without the cheese.  It
certainly resembles the yellowhammer's song, being
a short note, a musical chirp, rapidly repeated
several times.  But the yellowhammer varies his
song as to its time, the notes being sometimes fast
and sometimes slow.  The cirl's song is always the
same in this respect, and is always a more rapid song
than that of the other species.  So rapid is it that,
heard at a distance, it acquires almost the character
of a long trill.  In quality, too, it is the better
song&mdash;clearer, brighter, brisker&mdash;and it carries farther; on
still mornings I could hear one bird's song very
distinctly at a distance of two hundred and fifty
yards.  The only good description of the cirl bunting's
song&mdash;as well as the best general account of the bird's
habits&mdash;which I have found, is in J. C. Bellamy's
<i>Natural History of South Devon</i> (Plymouth and
London), 1839, probably a forgotten book.
</p>

<p>
The best singer among the British buntings, he
is also to my mind the prettiest bird.  When he is
described as black and brown, and lemon and sulphur-yellow,
and olive and lavender-grey, and chestnut-red,
we are apt to think that the effect of so many
colours thrown upon his small body cannot be very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
pleasing.  But it is not so; these various colours
are so harmoniously disposed, and have, in the
lighter and brighter hues in the living bird, such a
flower-like freshness and delicacy, that the effect is
really charming.
</p>

<p>
When, in June, I first visited the cottage, my host
took me into his dressing-room, and from it we
watched a pair of cirl buntings bring food to their
young in a nest in a small cypress standing just five
yards from the window.  The young birds were in
the pinfeather stage, but they were unfortunately
taken a very few days later by a rat, or stoat, or by
that winged nest-robber the jackdaw, whose small
cunning grey eyes are able to see into so many
hidden things.
</p>

<p>
The birds themselves did not grieve overlong at
their loss: the day after the nest was robbed the
cock was heard singing&mdash;and he continued to sing
every day from his favourite tree, an old black poplar
growing outside the sweetbriar hedge in front of
the cottage.
</p>

<p>
About this bird of a brave and cheerful disposition,
more will have to be said in the next chapter.
It is, or was, my desire to describe events in the
valley at this changeful period from late July to
October in the order of their occurrence, but in
all the rest of the present chapter, which will be
given to the river birds exclusively, the order
must be broken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Water-birds
</span>
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly the three commonest water-birds
inhabiting inland waters throughout England are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
the coot, moor-hen, and dabchick, or little grebe;
and on account of their abundance and general
distribution they are almost as familiar as our
domestic birds.  Yet one never grows tired of seeing
and hearing them, as we do of noting the actions
of other species that inhabit the same places; and
the reason for this&mdash;a very odd reason it seems!&mdash;is
because these three common birds, members of
two orders which the modern scientific zoologist
has set down among the lowest, and therefore, as
he tells us, most stupid, of the feathered inhabitants
of the globe, do actually exhibit a quicker intelligence
and greater variety in their actions and habits
than the species which are accounted their superiors.
</p>

<p>
The coot is not so abundant as the other two;
also he is less varied in his colour, and less lively in
his motions, and consequently attracts us less.  The
moor-hen is the most engaging, as well as the
commonest&mdash;a bird concerning which more entertaining
matter has been related in our natural histories than
of any other native species.  And I now saw a
great deal of him, and of the other two as well.
From the cottage windows, and from the lawn
outside, one looked upon the main current of the river,
and there were the birds always in sight; and when
not looking one could hear them.  Without paying
particular attention to them their presence in the
river was a constant source of interest and amusement.
</p>

<p>
At one spot, where the stream made a slight bend,
the floating water-weeds brought down by the current
were always being caught by scattered bulrushes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
growing a few feet from the edge; the arrested weeds
formed a minute group of islets, and on these
convenient little refuges and resting-places in the
waterway, a dozen or more of the birds could be seen at
most times.  The old coots would stand on the
floating weeds and preen and preen their plumage
by the hour.  They were like mermaids, for ever
combing out their locks, and had the clear stream
for a mirror.  The dull-brown, white-breasted young
coots, now fully grown, would meanwhile swim
about picking up their own food.  The moor-hens
were with them, preening and feeding, and one had
its nest there.  It was a very big conspicuous nest,
built up on a bunch of floating weeds, and formed,
when the bird was sitting on its eggs, a pretty and
curious object; for every day fresh bright-green
sedge leaves were plucked and woven round it, and
on that high bright-green nest, as on a throne, the
bird sat, and when I went near the edge of the water,
she (or he) would flirt her tail to display the
snowy-white under-feathers, and nod her head, and stand
up as if to display her pretty green legs, so as to let
me see and admire all her colours; and finally, not
being at all shy, she would settle quietly down again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Little grebes
</span>
</p>

<p>
The little grebes, too, had chosen that spot to build
on.  Poor little grebes! how they worked and sat,
and built and sat again, all the summer long.  And
all along the river it was the same thing&mdash;the grebes
industriously making their nests, and trying ever so
hard to hatch their eggs; and then at intervals of
a few days the ruthless water-keeper would come by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
with his long fatal pole to dash their hopes.  For
whenever he saw a suspicious-looking bunch of dead
floating weeds which might be a grebe's nest, down
would come the end of the pole on it, and the eggs
would be spilt out of the wet bed, and rolled down
by the swift water to the sea.  And then the birds
would cheerfully set to work again at the very same
spot: but it was never easy to tell which bunch of
wet weeds their eggs were hidden in.  Watching
with a glass I could see the hen on her eggs, but if
any person approached she would hastily pull the
wet weeds from the edge over them, and slip into
the water, diving and going away to some distance.
While the female sat the male was always busy,
diving and catching little fishes; he would dive down
in one spot, and suddenly pop up a couple of yards
away, right among the coots and moor-hens.  This
Jack-in-the-box action on his part never upset their
nerves.  They took not the slightest notice of him,
and were altogether a more or less, happy family,
all very tolerant of each other's little eccentricities.
</p>

<p>
The little grebe fished for himself and for his sitting
mate; he never seemed so happy and proud as when
he was swimming to her, patiently sitting on her wet
nest, with a little silvery fish in his beak.  He also
fished for old decaying weeds, which he fetched up
from the bottom to add to the nest.  Whenever he
popped up among or near the other birds with an old
rag of a weed in his beak, one or two of the grown-up
young coots would try to take it from him; and
seeing them gaining on him he would dive down to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
come up in another place, still clinging to the old
rag half a yard long; and again the chase would be
renewed, and again he would dive; until at last,
after many narrow escapes and much strategy, the
nest would be gained, and the sitting bird would
take the weed from him and draw it up and tuck it
round her, pleased with his devotedness, and at the
sight of his triumph over the coots.  As a rule,
after giving her something&mdash;a little fish, or a wet
weed to pull up and make herself comfortable with&mdash;they
would join their voices in that long trilling
cry of theirs, like a metallic, musical-sounding
policeman's rattle.
</p>

<p>
It was not in a mere frolicsome spirit that the
young coots hunted the dabchick with his weed, but
rather, as I imagine, because the white succulent stems
of aquatic plants growing deep in the water are
their favourite food; they are accustomed to have
it dived for by their parents and brought up to
them, and they never appear to get enough to satisfy
them; but when they are big, and their parents
refuse to slave for them, they seem to want to make
the little grebes their fishers for succulent stems.
</p>

<p>
One day in August 1899, I witnessed a pretty little
bird-comedy at the Pen Ponds, in Richmond Park,
which seemed to throw a strong light on the inner
or domestic life of the coot.  For a space of twenty
minutes I watched an old coot industriously diving
and bringing up the white parts of the stems of
<i>Polygonum persicaria</i>, which grows abundantly there,
together with the rarer more beautiful <i>Lymnanthemum nymphoïdes</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
which is called Lymnanth for short.  I
prefer an English name for a British plant, an
exceedingly attractive one in this case, and so beg
leave to call it Water-crocus.  The old bird was
attended by a full-grown young one, which she was
feeding, and the unfailing diligence and quickness
of the parent were as wonderful to see as the
gluttonous disposition of its offspring.  The old coot
dived at least three times every minute, and each
time came up with a clean white stem, the thickness
of a stout clay pipe-stem, cut the proper length&mdash;about
three to four inches.  This the young bird
would take and instantly swallow; but before it
was well down his throat the old bird would be gone
for another.  I was with a friend, and we wondered
when its devouring cormorant appetite would be
appeased, and how its maw could contain so much
food; we also compared it to a hungry Italian
greedily sucking down macaroni.
</p>

<p>
While this was going on a second young bird had
been on the old nest on the little island in the lake,
quietly dozing; and at length this one got off his
dozing-place, and swam out to where the weed-fishing
and feeding were in progress.  As he came
up, the old coot rose with a white stem in her beak,
which the new-comer pushed forward to take; but
the other thrust himself before him, and, snatching
the stem from his parent's beak, swallowed it
himself.  The old coot remained perfectly motionless
for a space of about four seconds, looking fixedly
at the greedy one who had been gorging for twenty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
minutes yet refused to give place to the other.  Then
very suddenly, and with incredible fury, she dashed
at and began hunting him over the pond.  In vain
he rose up and flew over the water, beating the
surface with his feet, uttering cries of terror; in
vain he dived; again and again she overtook and
dealt him the most savage blows with her sharp
beak, until, her anger thoroughly appeased and the
punishment completed, she swam back to the second
bird, waiting quietly at the same spot for her return,
and began once more diving for white stems of
the <i>Polygonum</i>.
</p>

<p>
Never again, we said, would the greedy young
bird behave in the unmannerly way which had
brought so terrible a castigation upon him!  The
coot is certainly a good mother who does not spoil
her child by sparing the rod.  And this is the bird
which our comparative anatomists, after pulling it
to pieces, tell us is a small-brained, unintelligent
creature; and which old Michael Drayton, who,
being a poet, ought to have known better, described
as "a formal brainless ass"!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Happy families
</span>
</p>

<p>
To come back to the Itchen birds.  The little
group, or happy family, I have described was but
one of the many groups of the same kind existing all
along the river; and these separate groups, though
at a distance from each other, and not exactly on
visiting terms, each being jealous of its own stretch
of water, yet kept up a sort of neighbourly intercourse
in their own way.  Single cries were heard at
all times from different points; but once or two or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
three times in the day a cry of a coot or a moor-hen
would be responded to by a bird at a distance; then
another would take it up at a more distant point,
and another still, until cries answering cries would
be heard all along the stream.  At such times the
voice of the skulking water-rail would be audible
too, but whether this excessively secretive bird had
any social relations with the others beyond joining
in the general greeting and outcry I could not
discover.  Thus, all these separate little groups,
composed of three different species, were like the members
of one tribe or people broken up into families; and
altogether it seemed that their lines had fallen to
them in pleasant places, although it cannot be
said that the placid current of their existence was
never troubled.
</p>

<p>
I know not what happened to disturb them, but
sometimes all at once cries were heard which were
unmistakably emitted in anger, and sounds of splashing
and struggling among the sedges and bulrushes;
and the rushes would be swayed about this way and
that, and birds would appear in hot pursuit of one
another over the water; and then, just when one was
in the midst of wondering what all this fury in their
cooty breasts could be about, lo! it would all be
over, and the little grebe would be busy catching
his silvery fishes; and the moor-hen, pleased as ever
at her own prettiness, nodding and prinking and
flirting her feathers; and the coot, as usual,
mermaid-like, combing out her slate-coloured tresses.
</p>

<p>
We have seen that of these three species the little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
grebe was not so happy as the others, owing to his
taste for little fishes being offensive to the
fish-breeder and preserver.  When I first saw how this
river was watched over by the water-keepers, I came
to the conclusion that very few or no dabchicks
would succeed in hatching any young.  And none
were hatched until August, and then to my surprise
I heard at one point the small, plaintive <i>peep-peep</i>
of the young birds crying to be fed.  One little grebe,
more cunning or more fortunate than the others,
had at last succeeded in bringing off her young; and
once out of their shells they were safe.  But by-and-by
the little duckling-like sound was heard at another
point, and then at another; and this continued in
September, until, by the middle of that month, you
could walk miles along the river, and before you
left the sound of one little brood hungrily crying to
be fed behind you, the little <i>peep-peep</i> of another
brood would begin to be heard in advance of you.
</p>

<p>
Often enough it is "dogged as does it" in bird as
well as in human affairs, and never had birds more
deserved to succeed than these dogged little grebes.
I doubt if a single pair failed to bring out at least a
couple of young by the end of September.  And at
that date you could see young birds apparently
just out of the shell, while those that had been
hatched in August were full grown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fishing-lessons
</span>
</p>

<p>
About the habits of the little grebe, as about those
of the moor-hen, many curious and entertaining
things have been written; but what amused me most
in these birds, when I watched them in late September
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
on the Itchen, was the skilful way in which
the parent bird taught her grown-up young ones to
fish.  At an early period the fishes given to the downy
young are very small, and are always well bruised
in the beak before the young bird is allowed to take
it, however eager he may be to seize it.  Afterwards,
when the young are more grown, the size of the
fishes is increased, and they are less and less bruised,
although always killed.  Finally, the young has to
be taught to catch for himself; and at first he does
not appear to have any aptitude for such a task,
or any desire to acquire it.  He is tormented with
hunger, and all he knows is that his parent can
catch fish for him, and his only desire is that she
shall go on catching them as fast as he can swallow
them.  And she catches him a fish, and gives it to
him, but, oh mockery! it was not really dead this
time, and instantly falls into the water and is lost!
Not hopelessly lost, however, for down she goes
like lightning, and comes up in ten seconds with it
again.  And he takes and drops it again, and looks
stupid, and again she recovers and gives it to him.
How many hundreds of times, I wonder, must this
lesson be repeated before the young grebe finds out
how to keep and to kill?  Yet that is after all only
the beginning of his education.  The main thing
is that he must be taught to dive after the fishes
he lets fall, and he appears to have no inclination,
no intuitive impulse, to do such a thing.  A small,
quite dead fish must be given him carelessly, so that
it shall fall, and he must be taught to pick up a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
fallen morsel from the surface; but from that first
simple act to the swift plunge and long chase after
and capture of uninjured vigorous fishes, what an
immense distance there is!  It is, however, probable
that, after the first reluctance of the young bird has
been overcome, and a habit of diving after escaped
fishes acquired, he makes exceedingly rapid progress.
</p>

<p>
But, even after the completion of his education,
when he is independent of his parents, and quick
and sure as they at capturing fishes down in their
own dim element, is it not still a puzzle and a
mystery that such a thing can be done?  And here
I speak not only of the little grebe, but of all birds
that dive after fishes, and pursue and capture them
in fresh or salt water.  We see how a kingfisher
takes his prey, or a tern, or gannet, or osprey, by
dropping upon it when it swims near the surface;
he takes his fish by surprise, as a sparrow-hawk
takes the bird he preys upon.  But no specialisation
can make an air-breathing, feathered bird an equal
of the fish under water.  One can see at a glance
in any clear stream that any fish can out-distance
any bird, darting off with the least effort so swiftly
as almost to elude the sight, while the fastest bird
under water moves but little faster than a water-rat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fascination
</span>
</p>

<p>
The explanation, I believe, is that the paralysing
effect on many small, persecuted creatures in the
presence of, or when pursued by, their natural
enemies and devourers, is as common under as
above the water.  I have distinctly seen this when
watching fish-eating birds being fed at the Zoological
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
Gardens in glass tanks.  The appearance of the bird
when he dives strikes an instant terror into them;
and it may then be seen that those which endeavour
to escape are no longer in possession of their full
powers, and their efforts to fly from the enemy are
like those of the mouse and vole when a weasel is
on their track, or of a frog when pursued by a snake;
while others remain suspended in the water, quite
motionless, until seized and swallowed.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Swifts
</span>
</p>

<p>
During the month of July the swift was the
most abundant and most constantly before
us of all our Itchen-valley birds.  In the
morning he was not there.  We had the pigeons
then, all three species&mdash;ring-dove, stock-dove and
turtle-dove&mdash;being abundant in the woods on the
opposite side of the valley, and from four o'clock
to six was the time of their morning concert, when
the still air was filled with the human-like musical
sound of their multitudinous voices mingled in one
voice.  An hour or two later, as the air grew warmer,
the swifts would begin to arrive to fly up and down the
stream incessantly until dark, feasting on the gnats
and ephemeræ that swarmed over the water during
those hot days of late summer.  Doubtless these
birds come every day from all the towns, villages,
and farm-houses scattered over a very broad strip
of country on either side of the Itchen.  Never had
I seen swifts so numerous; looking down on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
valley from any point one had hundreds of birds
in sight at once, all swiftly flying up and down
stream; but when the sight was kept fixed on any
one bird, it could be seen that he went but a short
distance&mdash;fifty to a hundred yards&mdash;then turned
back.  Thus each bird had a very limited range, and
probably each returned to his accustomed place or
beat every day.
</p>

<p>
These swifts are very much in the angler's way.
Frequently they get entangled in the line and are
brought down, but are seldom injured.  During one
day's fishing my friend here had three swifts to
disengage from his line.  On releasing one of these
birds he watched its movements, and saw it fly up
stream a distance of about forty yards, then double
back, mechanically going on with its fly-hunting up
and down stream just as if nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
It may be said of swifts, as Bates said of hummingbirds,
that, mentally, they are more like bees than
birds.  The infallible, unchangeable way in which
they, machine-like, perform all their actions, and
their absolute unteachableness, are certainly insect-like.
They are indeed so highly specialised and perfected
in their own line, and, on account of their
marvellous powers of flight, so removed from all
friction in that atmosphere in which they live and
move, above the complex and wit-sharpening
conditions in which the more terrestrial creatures of
their class exist, as to be practically independent
of experience.
</p>

<p>
It is known that for some time the mayfly has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
been decreasing, and in places disappearing altogether
from these Hampshire streams, and it is believed and
said by some of those who are concerned at these
changes that the swallow is accountable for them.
I do not know whether they have invented this
brilliant idea themselves or have taken it
ready-made from the water-keeper.  Probably the last,
since he, the water-keeper, is apt to regard all
creatures that come to the waters where his sacred
fishes are with a dull, hostile suspicion, though in
some cases he is not above adding to his income by
taking a few trout himself&mdash;not indeed with the dry
fly, which is useless at night, but with the shoe-net.
In any case the question of exterminating the
swallows in all the villages near the rivers has been
seriously considered.  Now, it is rather odd that this
notion about the swallow&mdash;the martin is of course
included&mdash;should have got about just when this
bird has itself fallen on evil times and is decreasing
with us.  This decrease has, in all parts of the country
best known to me, become increasingly rapid during
the last few years, and is probably due to new and
improved methods of taking the birds wholesale
during migration in France and Spain.  Putting that
matter aside, I should like to ask those gentlemen
who have decreed, or would like to decree, the
abolition of the swallow in all the riverside villages,
what they propose to do about the swift.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mayfly and swift
</span>
</p>

<p>
One day last June (1902) I was walking with two
friends by the Itchen, when a little below the village
of Ovington we sat down to rest and to enjoy a gleam
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
of sunshine which happened to visit the world about
noon that day.  We sat down on a little wooden
bridge over the main current and fell to watching
the swifts, which were abundant, flying up and down
just over our heads and, swift-like, paying no more
heed to us than if we had been three wooden posts
or three cows.  We noticed that ephemeræ of three
or four species were rising up, and, borne by a light
wind, drifting down-stream towards us and past us;
and after watching these flies for some time we
found that not one of them escaped.  Small and
grey, or dun, or water-coloured and well-nigh
invisible, or large and yellow and conspicuous as they
rose and slowly fluttered over the stream, they were
seen and snapped up, every one of them, by those
fateful sooty-coloured demons of the air, ever
streaming by on their swift scythe-shaped wings.  Not a
swallow nor a martin was in sight at that spot.
</p>

<p>
It is plain, then, that if the mayfly is declining and
dying out because some too greedy bird snatches its
life before it can lay its eggs to continue the species,
or drop upon the water to supply the trout with its
proper succulent food, the swift and not the swallow
is the chief culprit.
</p>

<p>
It is equally plain that these (from the angler's
point of view) injurious birds are not breeders by
the waterside.  Their numbers are too great: they
come, ninety per cent. of them I should say, from
farm-houses, villages, and towns at a distance of
a good many miles from the water.
</p>

<p>
The revels of the swifts were brought prematurely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
to an end by a great change in the weather, which
began with a thunderstorm on 27th July, and two
days later a greater storm, with hail the size of
big marrowfat peas, which fell so abundantly that
the little lawn was all white as if snow had fallen.
From that time onwards storm succeeded storm, and
finally the weather became steadily bad; and we
had rough, cold, wet days right on to the 10th of
August.  It was a terrible time for the poor holiday
people all over the country, and bad too for the
moulting and late-breeding birds.  As a small set-off to
all the discomfort of these dreary days, we had a
green lawn once more at the cottage.  I had made
one or two attempts at watering it, but the labour
proved too great to a lazy man, and now Nature had
come with her great watering-pot and restored its
spring-like verdure and softness.
</p>

<p>
During the wettest and coldest days I spent hours
watching the swallows and swifts flying about all
day long in the rain.  These are, indeed, our only
summer land-birds that never seek a shelter from the
wet, and which are not affected in their flight by a
wetted plumage.  Their upper feathers are probably
harder and more closely knit and impervious to
moisture than those of other kinds.  It may be seen
that a swallow or swift, when flying about in the rain,
at short intervals gives himself a quick shake as if
to throw off the raindrops.  Then, too, the food
and constant exercise probably serve to keep them
warmer than they would be sitting motionless in a
dry place.  Swifts, we sometimes see, are numbed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
and even perish of cold during frosty nights in spring;
I doubt that the cold ever kills them by day when
they can keep perpetually moving.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sand-martins
</span>
</p>

<p>
Day by day, during this long spell of summer wet
and cold, these birds diminished in number, until
they were almost all gone&mdash;swifts, swallows, and
house-martins; but we were not to be without a
swallow, for as these went, sand-martins came in,
and increased in numbers until they were in thousands.
We had them every day and all day before us, flying
up and down the valley, in the shelter of the woods,
their pale plumage and wavering flight making them
look in the distance like great white flies against the
wall of black-green trees and gloomy sky beyond.
</p>

<p>
On days when the sun shone they came in numbers
to perch on the telegraph wires stretched across a
field between the cottage and village.  It was beautiful
to see them, a double line fifty or sixty yards
long of the small, pale-coloured, graceful birdlings,
sitting so close together as to be almost touching,
all with their beaks pointing to the west, from where
the wind blew.
</p>

<p>
In this same field, one day when this pleasant
company were leaving us after a week's rest, I picked
up one that had killed himself by striking against
the wire.  A most delicate little dead swallow, looking
in his pale colouring and softness as moth-like in
death as he had seemed when alive and flying.  I
took him home&mdash;the little moth-bird pilgrim to
Africa, who had got no farther than the Itchen
on his journey&mdash;and buried him at the roots of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
honeysuckle growing by the cottage door.  It seemed
fittest that he should be put there, to become part
with the plant which, in the pallid yellows and dusky
reds of its blossoms, and in the perfume it gives
out so abundantly at eventide, has an expression of
melancholy, and is more to us in some of our moods
than any other flower.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An orphaned blackbird
</span>
</p>

<p>
The bad weather brought to our little plot of
ground a young blackbird, who had evidently been
thrown upon the world too early in life.  A good
number of blackbird broods had been brought off
in the bushes about us, and in the rough and tumble
of those tempestuous days some of the young had
no doubt got scattered and lost; this at all events
was one that had called and called to be fed and
warmed and comforted in vain&mdash;we had heard him
calling for days&mdash;and who had now grown prematurely
silent, and had soberly set himself to find his
own living as best he could.  Between the lawn and
the small sweetbriar hedge there was a strip of loose
mould where roses had been planted, and here the
bird had discovered that by turning over the dead
leaves and loose earth a few small morsels were to
be found.  During those cold, windy, wet days we
observed him there diligently searching in his poor,
slow little way.  He would strike his beak into the
loose ground, making a little hop forward at the
same time to give force to the stroke, and throw up
about as much earth as would cover a shilling-piece;
then he would gaze attentively at the spot, and after
a couple of seconds hop and strike again; and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
finally, if he could see nothing to eat, he would move
on a few inches and begin again in another place.
That was all his art&mdash;his one poor little way of
getting a living; and it was plain to see from his
bedraggled appearance and feeble motions, that he
was going the way of most young orphaned birds.
</p>

<p>
Now, I hate playing at providence among the
creatures, but we cannot be rid of pity; and there
are exceptional cases in which one feels justified in
putting out a helping hand.  Nature herself is not
always careless of the individual life: or perhaps it
would be better to say with Thoreau, "We are not
wholly involved in Nature."  And anxious to give
the poor bird a chance by putting him in a sheltered
place, and feeding him up, as Ruskin once did in
a like case, I set about catching him, but could not
lay hands on him, for he was still able to fly a little,
and always managed to escape pursuit among the
brambles, or else in the sedges by the waterside.
Half an hour after being hunted, he would be back
on the edge of the lawn prodding the ground in the
old feeble, futile way.  And the scraps of food I
cunningly placed for him he disregarded, not
knowing in his ignorance what was good for him.  Then
I got a supply of small earthworms, and, stalking
him, tossed them so as to cause them to fall near
him, and he saw and knew what they were, and
swallowed them hungrily; and he saw, too, that they
were thrown to him by a hand, and that the hand
was part of that same huge grey-clad monster that
had a little while back so furiously hunted him;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
and at once he seemed to understand the meaning
of it all, and instead of flying from he ran to meet
us, and, recovering his voice, called to be fed.  The
experience of one day made him a tame bird; on
the second day he knew that bread and milk, stewed
plums, pie-crust, and, in fact, anything we had to
give, was good for him; and in the course of the
next two or three days he acquired a useful knowledge
of our habits.  Thus, at half-past three in the
morning he would begin calling to be fed at the
bedroom window.  If no notice was taken of him he would
go away to try and find something for himself, and
return at five o'clock when breakfast was in
preparation, and place himself before the kitchen door.
Usually he got a small snack then; and at the
breakfast hour (six o'clock) he would turn up at
the dining-room window and get a substantial meal.
Dinner and tea time&mdash;twelve and half-past three
o'clock&mdash;found him at the same spot; but he was
often hungry between meals, and he would then
sit before one door or window and call, then move
to the next door, and so on until he had been all
round the cottage.  It was most amusing to see him
when, on our return from a long walk or a day out,
he would come to meet us, screaming excitedly,
bounding over the lawn with long hops, looking like
a miniature very dark-coloured kangaroo.
</p>

<p>
One day I came back alone to the cottage, and sat
down on the lawn in a canvas chair, to wait for my
companion who had the key.  The blackbird had seen,
and came flying to me, and pitching close to my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
feet began crying to be fed, shaking his wings, and
dancing about in a most excited state, for he had
been left a good many hours without food, and was
very hungry.  As I moved not in my chair he presently
ran round and began screaming and fluttering on
the other side of it, thinking, I suppose, that he had
gone to the wrong place, and that by addressing
himself to the back of my head he would quickly
get an answer.
</p>

<p>
The action of this bird in coming to be fed
naturally attracted a good deal of attention among the
feathered people about us; they would look on at
a distance, evidently astonished and much puzzled
at our bird's boldness in coming to our feet.  But
nothing dreadful happened to him, and little by little
they began to lose their suspicion; and first a
robin&mdash;the robin is always first&mdash;then other blackbirds
to the number of seven, then chaffinches and dunnocks,
all began to grow tame and to attend regularly
at meal-time to have a share in anything that was
going.  The most lively, active, and quarrelsome
member of this company was our now glossy foundling;
and it troubled us to think that in feeding him
we were but staving off the evil day when he would
once more have to fend for himself.  Certainly we were
teaching him nothing.  But our fears were idle.
The seven wild blackbirds that had formed a habit
of coming to share his food were all young birds,
and as time went on and the hedge fruit began to
ripen, we noticed that they kept more and more
together.  Whenever one was observed to fly straight
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
away to some distance, in a few moments another
would follow, then another; and presently it would
be seen that they were all making their way to some
spot in the valley, or to the woods on the other side.
After several hours' absence they would all reappear
on the lawn, or near it, at the same time, showing
that they had been together throughout the day and
had returned in company.  After observing them in
their comings and goings for several weeks I felt
convinced that this species has in it the remains of
a gregarious instinct which affects the young birds.
Our bird, as a member of this little company, must
have quickly picked up from the others all that it
was necessary for him to know, and at last it was
plain to us from his behaviour at the cottage that
he was doing very well for himself.  He was often
absent most of the day with the others, and on his
return late in the afternoon he would pick over the
good things placed for him in a leisurely way,
selecting a morsel here and there, and eating more out
of compliment to us, as it seemed, than because he
was hungry.  But up to the very last, when he had
grown as hardy and strong on the wing as any of
his wild companions, he kept up his acquaintance
with and confidence in us; and even at night when
I would go out to where most of our wild birds
roosted, in the trees and bushes growing in a vast old
chalk-pit close to the cottage, and called "Blackie,"
instantly there would be a response&mdash;a softly
chuckled note, like a sleepy "Good-night," thrown
back to me out of the darkness.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cirl bunting
</span>
</p>

<p>
During the spell of rough weather which brought
us the blackbird, my interest was centred in the
cirl buntings.  On 4th August, I was surprised to
find that they were breeding again in the little
sweetbriar hedge, and had three fledglings about a
week old in the nest.  They had on this occasion
gone from the west to the east side of the cottage,
and the new nest, two to three feet from the ground,
was placed in the centre of a small tangle of
sweet-briar, bramble, and bryony, within a few yards of
the trunk of the big lime tree under which I was
accustomed to sit.  I had this nest under observation
until 9th August, which happened to be the worst
day, the coldest, wettest, and windiest of all that
wintry spell; and yet in such weather the young
birds came out of their cradle.  For a couple of days
they remained near the nest concealed among some
low bushes; then the whole family moved away to
a hedge at some distance on higher ground, and there
I watched the old birds for some days feeding their
young on grasshoppers.
</p>

<p>
The result of my observations on these birds
and on three other pairs which I found breeding
close by&mdash;one in the village, another just outside of
it, and the third by the thorn-grown foundation of
ruined Abbotstone not far off&mdash;came as a surprise
to me; for it appeared that the cirl in its breeding
habits and language was not like other buntings,
nor indeed like any other bird.  The young hatched
out of the curiously marked or "written" eggs are
like those of the yellowhammer, black as moor-hen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
chicks in their black down, opening wide crimson
mouths to be fed.  But should the parent birds, or
one of them, be watching you at the nest, they
will open not their beaks, but hearing and obeying
the warning note they lie close as if glued to the
bottom of the nest.  It is a curious sound.  Unless
one knows it, and the cause of it, one may listen
a long time and not discover the bird that utters
it.  The buntings sit as usual, motionless and unseen
among the leaves of the tree, and, so long as you
are near the nest, keep up the sound, an excessively
sharp metallic chirp, uttered in turns by both birds,
but always a short note in the female, and a double
note in the male, the second one prolonged to a wail
or squeal.  No other bird has an alarm or warning
note like it: it is one of those very high sounds
that are easily missed by the hearing, like the robin's
fine-drawn wail when in trouble about his young;
but when you catch and listen to it the effect on
the brain is somewhat distressing.  A Hampshire
friend and naturalist told me that a pair of these
birds that bred in his garden almost drove him
crazy with their incessant sharp alarm note.
</p>

<p>
The effect of this warning sound on the young is
very striking: before they can fly or are fit to leave
the nest, they are ready, when approached too closely,
to leap like startled frogs out of the nest, and scuttle
away into hiding on the ground.  Once they have
flown they are extremely difficult to find, as, on
hearing the parent's warning note, they squat down on
their perch and remain motionless as a leaf among
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
the leaves.  Often I could only succeed in making
them fly by seizing and shaking the branches of a
thorn or other bush in which I knew they were
hidden.  So long as the young bird keeps still on its
branch, the old bird on some tree twenty or thirty
or forty yards away remains motionless, though
all the time emitting the sharp, puzzling, warning
sound; but the very instant that the young bird
quits his perch, darting suddenly away, the parent
bird is up too, shooting out so swiftly as almost to
elude the sight, and in a moment overtakes and flies
with the young bird, hugging it so closely that the
two look almost like one.  Together they dart away
to a distance, usually out over a field, and drop and
vanish in the grass.  But in a few moments the parent
bird is back again, sitting still among the leaves,
emitting the shrill sound, ready to dart away with
the next young bird that seeks to escape by flight.
</p>

<p>
This method of attending and safe-guarding the
young is, indeed, common among birds, but in no
species known to me is it seen in such vigour and
perfection.  What most strikes one is the change
from immobility when the bird sits invisible among
the leaves, marking the time with those excessively
sharp, metallic clicks and wails like a machine-bird,
to unexpected, sudden, brilliant activity.
</p>

<p>
When not warned into silence and immobility by
the parent the young cirls are clamorous enough,
crying to be fed, and these, too, have voices of an
excessive sharpness.  Of other native species the
sharpest hunger-cries that I know are those of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
tits, especially the long-tailed tit, and the spotted
fly-catcher; but these sounds are not comparable in
brain-piercing acuteness to those of the young cirls.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I have wondered at in a creature
of so quiet a disposition as the cirl bunting is the
extraordinary violence of the male towards other
small birds when by chance they come near his
young, in or out of the nest.  So jealous is he that he
will attack a willow-wren or a dunnock with as much
fury as other birds use only towards the most deadly
enemies of their young.
</p>

<p>
Here, by the Itchen, where we have all four
buntings, I find that the reed-bunting&mdash;called black-head
or black-top&mdash;is, after the cirl, the latest singer.
He continues when, towards the end of August, the
corn-bunting and yellowhammer become silent.  He
is the poorest singer of the bunting tribe, the first
part of his song being like the chirp of an excited
sparrow, somewhat shriller, and then follows the
long note, shrill too, or sibilant and tremulous.  It
is more like the distressful hunger-call of some young
birds than a song-note.  A reedy sound in a reedy
place, and one likes to hear it in the green valley
among the wind-rustled, sword-shaped leaves and
waving spears of rush and aquatic grass.  So fond
is he of his own music that he will sing even when
moulting.  I was amused one day when listening
to a reed-bunting sitting on a top branch of a dwarf
alder tree in the valley of Ovington, busily occupied
in preening his fluffed-out and rather ragged-looking
plumage, yet pausing at short intervals in his task
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P279"></a>279}</span>
to emit his song.  So taken up was he with the
feather-cleaning and singing, that he took no notice of me
when I walked to within twenty-five yards of him.
By-and-by, in passing one of his long flight-feathers
through his beak it came out, at which he appeared
very much surprised.  First he raised his head, then
began turning it about this way and that, as if
admiring the feather he held, or trying to get a better
sight of it.  For quite a minute he kept it, forgetting
to sing, then in turning it about he accidentally
dropped it.  Bending his head down, he watched its
slow fall to the grass below very intently, and
continued gazing down even after it was on the ground;
then, pulling himself together, he resumed the
feather-preening task, with its musical interludes.
</p>

<p>
The worst day during the bad weather when the
young cirl buntings left the nest brought the wintry
spell to an end.  A few days of such perfect weather
followed that one could wish for no higher good than
to be alive on that green earth, beneath that blue
sky.  One could best appreciate the crystal purity
and divine blueness of the immense space by watching
the rooks revelling on high in the morning sunshine,
looking in their blackness against the crystalline
blue like bird-figures with outspread, motionless wings,
carved out of anthracite coal, and suspended by
invisible wires in heaven.  You could watch them, a
numerous company, moving upward in wide circles,
the sound of their voices coming fainter and fainter
back to earth, until at that vast height they seemed
no bigger than humble-bees.
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
The oak in August
</span>
</p>

<p>
This clarity of atmosphere had a striking effect,
too, on the appearance of the trees, and I could not
help noticing the superiority of the oak to all other
forest trees in this connection.  There comes a time
in late summer when at last it loses that "glad light
grene" which has distinguished it among its
dark-leafed neighbours, and made it in our eyes a type of
unfading spring and of everlastingness.  It grows
dark, too, at last, and is as dark as a cypress or a
cedar of Lebanon; but observe how different this
depth of colour is from that of the elm.  The elm,
too, stands alone, or in rows, or in isolated groups
in the fields, and in the clear sunshine its foliage
has a dull, summer-worn, almost rusty green.  There
is no such worn and weary look in the foliage of the
oak in August and September.  It is of a rich, healthy
green, deep but undimmed by time and weather,
and the leaf has a gloss to it.  Again, on account of
its manner of growth, with widespread branches and
boughs and twigs well apart, the foliage does not
come before us as a mere dense mass of green&mdash;an
intercepting cloud, as in a painted tree; but the sky
is seen through it, and against the sky are seen the
thousand thousand individual leaves, clear-cut and
beautiful in shape.
</p>

<p>
It was one of my daily pleasures during this fine
weather to go out and look at one of the solitary
oak trees growing in the adjoining field when the
morning sunlight was on it.  To my mind it looked
best when viewed at a distance of sixty to seventy
yards across the open grass field with nothing but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
the sky beyond.  At that distance not only could
the leaves be distinctly seen, but the acorns as well,
abundantly and evenly distributed over the whole
tree, appearing as small globes of purest bright
apple-green among the deep green foliage.  The
effect was very rich, as of tapestry with an oak-leaf
pattern and colour, sprinkled thickly over with
round polished gems of a light-green sewn into
the fabric.
</p>

<p>
To an artist with a soul in him, the very sight of
such a tree in such conditions would, I imagined,
make him sick of his poor little ineffectual art.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The oak in the field and a flowering plant by
the water were the two best things plant
life contained for me during those beautiful
late summer days by the Itchen.  About the
waterside flower I must write at some length.
</p>

<p>
Of our wild flowers the yellow in colour, as a rule,
attract me least; not because the colour is not
beautiful to me, but probably on account of the numerous
ungraceful, weedy-looking plants of unpleasant scent
which in late summer produce yellow flowers&mdash;tansy,
fleabane, ragwort, sow-thistle, and some of other
orders, the worst of the lot being the pepper
saxifrage, an ungainly parsley in appearance, with
evil-smelling flowers.  You know them by their odours.
If I were to smell at a number of strong-scented
flowers unknown to me in a dark room, or blindfolded,
I should be able to pick out the yellow ones.
</p>

<p>
They would have the yellow smell.  The yellow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
smell has an analogue in the purple taste.  It may be
fancy, but it strikes me that there is a certain family
resemblance in the flavours of most purple fruits,
or their skins&mdash;the purple fruit-flavour which is so
strong in damson, sloe, black currant, blackberry,
mulberry, whortleberry, and elderberry.
</p>

<p>
All the species I have named were common in the
valley, and there were others&mdash;St. John's wort, yellow
loosestrife, etc.&mdash;which, although not ungraceful nor
evil-smelling, yet failed to attract.  Nevertheless, as
the days and weeks went on and brought yet another
conspicuous yellow waterside flower into bloom,
which became more and more abundant as the season
advanced, while the others, one by one, faded and
failed from the earth, until, during the last half of
September, it was in its fullest splendour, I was
completely won by it, and said in my haste that it was
the brightest blossom in all the Hampshire garland,
if not the loveliest wild flower in England.  Nor was
it strange, all things considered, that I was so taken
with its beauty, since, besides being beautiful, it was
new to me, and therefore had the additional charm
of novelty; and, finally, it was at its best when all
the conspicuous flowers that give touches of brilliant
colour here and there to the green of this greenest
valley, including most of the yellow flowers I have
mentioned, were faded and gone.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mimulus luteus
</span>
</p>

<p>
No description of this flower, <i>Mimulus luteus</i>,
known to the country people as "wild musk," is
needed here&mdash;it is well known as a garden plant.
The large foxglove-shaped flowers grow singly on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
their stems among the topmost leaves, and the form
of stem, leaf, and flower is a very perfect example of
that kind of formal beauty in plants which is called
"decorative."  This character is well shown in the
accompanying figure, reduced to little more than half
the natural size, from a spray plucked at Bransbury,
on the Test.  But the shape is nothing, and is scarcely
seen or noticed twenty-five to fifty yards away, the
proper distance at which to view the blossoming
plants; not indeed as a plant-student or an admirer
of flowers in a garden would view it, as the one thing
to see, but merely as part of the scene.  The colour
is then everything.  There is no purer, no more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
beautiful yellow in any of our wild flowers, from
the primrose and the almost equally pale, exquisite
blossom which we improperly name "dark mullein"
in our books on account of its lovely purple eye, to
the intensest pure yellow of the marsh marigold.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-284.jpg" alt="MIMULUS LUTEUS" />
<br />
MIMULUS LUTEUS
</p>

<p>
But although purity of colour is the chief thing,
it would not of itself serve to give so great a
distinction to this plant; the charm is in the colour
and the way in which Nature has disposed it,
abundantly, in single, separate blossoms, among leaves
of a green that is rich and beautiful, and looks almost
dark by contrast with that shining, luminous hue it
sets off so well.
</p>

<p>
On 17th September it was Harvest Festival Sunday
at the little church at Itchen Abbas, where I
worshipped that day, and I noticed that the decorators
had dressed up the font with water-plants and flowers
from the river; reeds and reed-mace, or cat's-tail,
and the yellow mimulus.  It was a mistake.  Deep
green, glossy foliage, and white and brilliantly
coloured flowers look well in churches; white
chrysanthemums, arums, azaleas, and other conspicuous
white flowers; and scarlet geraniums, and many
other garden blooms which seen in masses in the
sunshine hurt the sense&mdash;cinerarias, calceolarias,
larkspurs, etc.  The subdued light of the interior
softens the intensity, and sometimes crudity, of
the strongest colours, and makes them suitable for
decoration.  The effect is like that of stained-glass
windows, or of a bright embroidery on a sober ground.
The graceful, grey, flowery reeds, and the light-green
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
reed-mace, with its brown velvet head, and the
moist yellow of the mimulus, which quickly loses
its freshness, look not well in the dim, religious light
of the old village church.  These should be seen
where the sunlight and wind and water are, or not
seen at all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mimulus and Camaloté
</span>
</p>

<p>
Beautiful as the mimulus is when viewed in its
natural surroundings, by running waters amidst the
greys and light and dark greens of reed and willow,
and of sedge and aquatic grasses, and water-cress,
and darkest bulrush, its attractiveness was to me
greatly increased by association.  Now to say that
a flower which is new to one can have any associations
may sound very strange, but it is a fact in this
case.  Viewing it at a distance of, say, forty or fifty
yards, as a flower of a certain size, which might be
any shape, in colour a very pure, luminous yellow,
blooming in profusion all over the rich green, rounded
masses of the plants, as one may see it in September
at Ovington, and at many other points on the Itchen,
from its source to Southampton Water, and on the
Test, I am so strongly reminded of the yellow camaloté
of the South American watercourses that the memory
is almost like an illusion.  It has the pure, beautiful
yellow of the river camaloté; in its size it is like
that flower; it grows, too, in the same way, singly,
among rounded masses of leaves of the same lovely
rich green; and the camaloté, too, has for neighbours
the green blades of the sedges, and grey,
graceful reeds, and multitudinous bulrushes, their
dark polished stems tufted with brown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
</p>

<p>
Looking at these masses of blossoming mimulus
at Ovington, I am instantly transported in thought
to some waterside thousands of miles away.  The
dank, fresh smell is in my nostrils; I listen
delightedly to the low, silvery, water-like gurgling note
of the little kinglet in his brilliant feathers among
the rushes, and to the tremulous song of the green
marsh-grasshoppers or leaf-crickets; and with a
still greater delight do I gaze at the lovely yellow
flower, the unforgotten camaloté, which is as much
to me as the wee, modest, crimson-tipped daisy was
to Robert Burns or to Chaucer; and as the primrose,
the violet, the dog-rose, the shining, yellow
gorse, and the flower o' the broom, and bramble,
and hawthorn, and purple heather are to so many
inhabitants of these islands who were born and
bred amid rural scenes.
</p>

<p>
On referring to the books for information as to
the history of the mimulus as a British wild flower,
I found that in some it was not mentioned, and
in others mentioned only to be dismissed with the
remark that it is an "introduced plant."  But when
was it introduced, and what is its range?  And whom
are we to ask?
</p>

<p>
After an infinite amount of pains, seeing and
writing to all those among my acquaintances who
have any knowledge of our wild plant life, I
discovered that the mimulus grows more or less
abundantly in or by streams here and there in most
English counties, but is more commonly met with
south of Derbyshire; also that it extends to Scotland,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
and is known even in the Orkneys.  Finally, a
botanical friend discovered for me that as long
ago as 1846 there had been a great discussion, in
which a number of persons took part, on this very
subject of the date of the naturalisation in Britain
of the mimulus, in Edward Newman's botanical
magazine, the <i>Phytologist</i>.  It was shown conclusively
by a correspondent that the plant had established
itself at one point as far back as the year 1815.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A British species?
</span>
</p>

<p>
There may exist more literature on the subject if
one knew where to look for it; but we are certainly
justified in feeling annoyed at the silence of the
makers of books on British wild flowers, and the
compilers of local lists and floras.  And what, we
should like to ask of our masters, is a British wild
flower?  Does not the same rule apply to plants as
to animals&mdash;namely, that when a species, whether
"introduced" or imported by chance or by human
agency, has thoroughly established itself on our soil,
and proved itself able to maintain its existence in a
state of nature, it becomes, and is, a British species?
If this rule had not been followed by zoologists, even
our beloved little rabbit would not be a native, to
say nothing of our familiar brown rat and our
black-beetle: and the pheasant, and red-legged partridge,
and capercailzie, and the fallow-deer, and a frog, and
a snail, and goodness knows how many other British
species, introduced into this country by civilised man,
some in recent times.  And, going farther back in
time, it may be said that every species has at some
time been brought, or has brought itself, from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P289"></a>289}</span>
otherwhere&mdash;every animal from the red deer and the white
cattle, to the smallest, most elusive microbe not yet
discovered; and every plant from the microscopical
fungus to the British oak and the yew.  The main
thing is to have a rule in such a matter, a simple,
sensible rule, like that of the zoologist, or some other;
and what we should like to know from the botanists
is&mdash;Have they got a rule, and, if so, what is it?  There
are many who would be glad of an answer to this
question: judging from the sale of books on British
wild flowers during the last few years, there must
be several millions of persons in this country who
take an interest in the subject.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A visit to Swarraton
</span>
</p>

<p>
One bright September day, when the mimulus was
in its greatest perfection, and my new pleasure in
the flower at its highest, I by chance remembered
that Gilbert White, of Selborne, in the early part
of his career, had been curate for a time at Swarraton,
a small village on the Itchen, near its source,
about four miles above Alresford.  That was in
1747.  To Swarraton I accordingly went, only to
find what any guide-book or any person would have
told me, that the church no longer exists.  Only the
old churchyard remained, overgrown with nettles,
the few tombstones that had not been carried away
so covered with ivy as to appear like green mounds.
A group of a dozen yews marked the spot where the
church had formerly stood; and there were besides
some very old trees, an ancient yew and a giant
beech, and others, and just outside the ground as
noble an ash tree as I have ever seen.  These three,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
at any rate, must have been big trees a century
and a half ago, and well known to Gilbert White.
On inquiry I was told that the church had been
pulled down a very long time back&mdash;about forty
years, perhaps; that it was a very old and very
pretty church, covered with ivy, and that no one
knew why it was pulled down.  The probable reason
was that a vast church was being or about to be
built at the neighbouring village of Northington, big
enough to hold all the inhabitants of the two parishes
together, and about a thousand persons besides.
This immense church would look well enough among
the gigantic structures of all shapes and materials
in the architectural wonderland of South Kensington.
But I came not to see this building: the little ancient
village church, in which the villagers had worshipped
for several centuries, where Gilbert White did duty
for a year or so, was what I wanted, and I was
bitterly disappointed.  Looking away from the
weed-grown churchyard, I began to wonder what his
feelings would be could he revisit this old familiar
spot.  The group of yew trees where the church had
stood, and the desolate aspect of the ground about
it would disturb and puzzle his mind; but, on
looking farther, all the scene would appear as he
had known it so long ago&mdash;the round, wooded hills,
the green valley, the stream, and possibly some of
the old trees, and even the old cottages.  Then his
eyes would begin to detect things new and strange.
First, my bicycle, leaning against the trunk of the
great ash tree, would arrest his attention; but in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
a few moments, before he could examine it closely
and consider for what purpose it was intended,
something far more interesting and more wonderful
to him would appear in sight.  Five large birds
standing quietly on the green turf beside the
stream&mdash;birds never hitherto seen.  Regarding them
attentively, he would see that they were geese, and it
would appear to him that they were of two species,
one white and grey in colour, with black legs, the
other a rich maroon red, with yellow legs; also
that they were both beautiful and more graceful in
their carriage than any bird of their family known
to him.  Before he would cease wondering at the
presence at Swarraton of these Magellanic geese,
no longer strange to any living person's eye in
England, lo! a fresh wonder&mdash;beautiful yellow
flowers by the stream, unlike any flower that grew
there in his day, or by any stream in Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
But how long after White's time did that flower run
wild in Hampshire? I asked, and then thought that
I might get the answer from some old person who
had spent a long life at that spot.
</p>

<p>
I went no farther than the nearest cottage to find
the very one I wanted, an ancient dame of seventy-four,
who had never lived anywhere but in that
small thatched cottage at the side of the old
churchyard.  She was an excessively thin old dame, and
had the appearance of a walking skeleton in a worn
old cotton gown; and her head was like a skull
with a thin grey skin drawn tightly over the sharp
bones of the face, with pale-coloured living eyes in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
the sockets.  Her scanty grey hair was gathered in
a net worn tightly on her head like a skull-cap.  The
old women in the villages here still keep to this
long-vanished fashion.
</p>

<p>
I asked this old woman to tell me about the
yellow flowers by the water, and she said that they
had always been there.  I told her she must be
mistaken; and after considering for awhile she
assured me that they grew there in abundance when
she was quite young.  She distinctly remembered
that before her marriage&mdash;and that was over fifty
years ago&mdash;she often went down to the stream to
gather flowers, and would come in with great handfuls
of wild musk.
</p>

<p>
When she had told me this, even before she had
finished speaking, I seemed to see two persons before
me&mdash;the lean old woman with her thin colourless
visage, and, coming in from the sunshine, a young
woman with rosy face, glossy brown hair and
laughing blue eyes, her hands full of brightest yellow
wild musk from the stream.  And the visionary
woman seemed to be alive and real, and the other
unsubstantial, a delusion of the mind, a ghost of
a woman.
</p>

<p>
But was the old woman right&mdash;was the beautiful
yellow mimulus, the wild musk or water-buttercup
as she called it, which our botanists refuse to admit
into their works intended for our instruction, or
give it only half a dozen dry words&mdash;was it a
common wild flower on the Hampshire rivers more than
half a century ago?
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
Bird life on the downs
</span>
</p>

<p>
From the valley and the river with its shining
yellow mimulus and floating water-grass in the
crystal current&mdash;that green hair-like grass that one
is never tired of looking at&mdash;back to the ivy-green
cottage, its ancient limes and noble solitary oaks,
and, above all, its birds; then back again to the
stream&mdash;that mainly was our life.  But close by on
either side of the valley were the downs, and these
too drew us with that immemorial fascination which
the higher ground has for all of us, because of the
sense of freedom and power which comes with a
wide horizon.  That was a fine saying of Lord Herbert
of Cherbury that a man mounted on a good horse
is lifted above himself: one experiences the feeling
in a greater degree on any chalk down.  One extensive
open down within easy distance was a favourite
afternoon walk.  Here on the short fragrant turf
an army of pewits were to be found every day,
and usually there were a few stone-curlews with
them.  It is not here as in the country about
Salisbury, where the Hawking Club has its headquarters,
and where they have been "having fun with the
thick-knees," as they express it in their lingo, until
there are no thick-knees left.  But the chief attraction
of this down was an extensive thicket of thorn
and bramble, mixed with furze and juniper and
some good-sized old trees, where birds were
abundant, many of them still breeding.  Here, down
to the end of September, I found turtle-doves' nests
with newly-hatched young and incubated eggs.  I
always felt more than compensated for scratches
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
and torn clothes when I found young turtle-doves
in the down, as the little creatures are then
delightful to look at.  Sitting hunched up on its platform,
the head with its massive bulbous beak drawn
against its arched back, the little thing is less like
a bird than a mammal in appearance&mdash;a singularly
coloured shrew, let us say.  The colour is indeed
strange, the whole body, the thick, fleshy, snout-like
beak included, being a deep, intense, almost indigo
blue, and the loose hair-like down on the head and
upper parts a light, bright primrose yellow.
</p>

<p>
There are surprising colours in some young birds:
the cirl nestling, as we have seen, is black and
crimson&mdash;clothed in black down with gaping crimson mouth;
loveliest of all is the young snipe in down of brown-gold,
frosted with silvery white; but for quaintness
and fantastic colouring the turtle-dove nestling has
no equal.  In all of our native doves, and probably
in all doves everywhere, the skin is blue and the
down yellow, but the colours differ in intensity.
I tried to find a newly-hatched stock-dove to compare
it with the turtle nestling but failed, although the
species is quite common and, like the other two,
breeds till October.  Ring-dove nestlings were easy
to see, but in these the blue colour, though deep on
the beak and head, is quite pale on the body, fading
almost to white on some parts; and the down, too,
is very pale, fading to whitish tow-colour on the
sides and back.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A boy naturalist
</span>
</p>

<p>
When seeking for a ring-dove in down I had an
amusing adventure.  At a distance of some miles
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
from the Itchen, near the Test, one day in September,
I was hunting for an insect I wanted in a thick
copse by Tidbury Ring, an ancient earthwork on
the summit of a chalk hill.  Hearing a boy's voice
singing near, I peeped out and saw a lad of about
fifteen tending some sheep: he was walking about
on his knees, trimming the herbage with an old
rusty pair of shears which he had found!  It startled
him a little when I burst out of the cover so near
him, but he was ready to enter into conversation,
and we had a long hour together, sitting on the
sunny down.  I mentioned my desire to find a
newly-hatched ring-dove, and he at once offered
to show me one.  There were two nests with young
close by, in one the birds were half-fledged, the others
only came out of their shells two days before.  These
we went to look for, the boy leading the way to a
point where the trees grew thickest.  He climbed
a yew, and from the yew passed to a big beech
tree, in which the nest was placed, but on getting
to it he cried out that the nest was forsaken and
the young dead.  He threw them down to me, and he
was grieved at their death as he had known about
the nest from the time it was made, and had seen
the young birds alive the day before.  No doubt
the parents had been shot, and the cold night had
quickly killed the little ones.
</p>

<p>
This was the most intelligent boy I have met in
Hampshire; he knew every bird and almost every
insect I spoke to him about.  He was, too, a mighty
hunter of little birds, and had captured stock-doves
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
and wheatears in the rabbit burrows.  But his
greatest feat was the capture of a kingfisher.  He
was down by the river with a sparrow-net at a spot
where the bushes grow thick and close to the water,
when he saw a kingfisher come and alight on a dead
twig within three yards of him.  The bird had not
seen him standing behind the bush: it sat for a
few moments on the twig, its eyes fixed on the
water, then it dropped swiftly down, and he jumped
out and threw the net over it just as it rose up with
a minnow in its beak.  He took it home and put
it in a cage.
</p>

<p>
I gave him a sharp lecture on the cruelty of caging
kingfishers, telling him how senseless it was to
confine such a bird, and how impossible to keep it
alive in prison.  It was better to kill them at once
if he wanted to destroy them.  "Of course your
kingfisher died," I said.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied.  He stood the cage on a chair,
and the bird was no sooner in it than his little sister,
a child of two who was fidgeting round, pulled the
door open and out flew the kingfisher!

<span class="sidenote">
Birds at the cottage
</span>
</p>

<p>
Returning to the cottage, whether from the high
down, the green valley, or the silent, shady wood,
it always seemed a favourite dwelling- or nesting-place
of the birds, where indeed they most abounded.
Now that bright genial weather had come after the
cold and storm to make them happy, the air was
full of their chirpings and twitterings, their various
little sounds of conversation and soliloquy, with an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
occasional bright, loud, perfect song.  It was
generally the wren, whose lyric changes not through all
the changeful year, that uttered it.  It was this
small brown bird, too, that amused me most with
the spectacle of his irrepressible delight in the new
warmth and sunlight.  There were about a dozen
wrens at the cottage, and some of them were
in the habit of using their old undamaged nests in
the ivy and woodbine as snug little dormitories.
But they cared nothing for the human inhabitants
of the cottage; they were like small birds that had
built their nest in the interstices of an eagles' eyrie,
who knew nothing and cared nothing about the
eagles.  Occasionally, when a wren peeped in from
the clustering ivy or hopped on to a window-sill
and saw us inside, he would scold us for being there
with that sharp, angry little note of his, and then
fly away.  Nor would he take a crumb from the
table spread out of doors every day for the birds
that disdained not to be fed.  The ivy and creepers
that covered the cottage abounded with small
spiders, caterpillars, earwigs, chrysalids, and what
not; that was good enough for him&mdash;Thank you
for your kind intentions!
</p>

<p>
Looking from a window at a bed of roses a few
feet away, I discovered that the wren took as much
pleasure in a dust bath as any bird.  He would come
to the loose soil and select a spot where the bed
sloped towards the sun, and then wriggle about in
the earth with immense enjoyment.  Dusting himself,
he would look like a miniature partridge with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
a round body not much bigger than a walnut.  After
dusting would come the luxurious sun-bath, when,
with feathers raised and minute wings spread out
and beak gaping, the little thing would lie
motionless and panting; but at intervals of three or four
seconds a joyful fit of shivering would seize him,
and at last, the heat becoming too great, he would
shake himself and skip away, looking like a brown
young field-vole scuttling into cover.
</p>

<p>
This bright and beautiful period came to an end
on 22nd August, and we then had unsettled weather
with many sudden changes until 3rd September&mdash;cloudy
oppressive days, violent winds, thunderstorms,
and days of rain and sunshine, and morning
and evening rainbows; it was a mixture of April,
midsummer, and October.
</p>

<p>
This changeful period over, there was fine settled
weather; it was the golden time of the year, and it
continued till our departure on the last day of September.
</p>

<p>
The fruit season was late this year&mdash;nearly a fortnight
later than in most years; and when the earliest,
the wild arum, began to ripen, the birds&mdash;thrushes
and chaffinches were detected&mdash;fell upon and devoured
all the berries, regardless of their poisonous character
almost before their light-green had changed to vivid
scarlet.  Then came the deep crimson fruit of the
honeysuckle; it ripened plentifully on the plants
growing against the cottage, and the cole-tits came
in bands to feed on it.  It was pretty to see these
airy little acrobats clinging to the twine-like pendent
sprays hanging before an open window or door.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
They were like the little birds in a Japanese picture
which one has seen.  Then came the elderberries,
which all fruit-loving birds feast on together.  But
the tits and finches and warblers and thrushes were
altogether out-numbered by the starlings that came
in numbers from the pasture-lands to take part in
the great fruit-feast.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An old chalk pit
</span>
</p>

<p>
The elder is a common tree here, but at the cottage
we had, I think, the biggest crop of fruit in the
neighbourhood; and it now occurs to me that the vast
old chalk pit in which the trees grew has not yet
been described, and so far has only been once
mentioned incidentally.  Yet it was a great place, but a
few yards away at the side of the old lime trees and
the small protecting fence.  The entrance to it and
its wide floor was on a level with the green valley,
while at its upper end it formed a steep bank forty
feet high.  It was doubtless a very old pit, with sides
which had the appearance of natural cliffs and were
overhung and draped with thorn-trees, masses of
old ivy, and traveller's joy.  Inside it was a pretty
tangled wilderness; on the floor many tall annuals
flourished&mdash;knapweed and thistle and dark mullein
and teazel, six to eight feet high.  Then came some
good-sized trees&mdash;ash and oak&mdash;and thorn, bramble
and elder in masses.  It was a favourite breeding-place
of birds of many species; even the red-backed
shrike had nested there within forty yards of a
human habitation, and the kingfisher had safely
reared his young, unsuspected by the barbarous
water-keeper.  The pit, too, was a shelter in cold
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
rough weather and a roosting-place at night.  Now
the fruit was ripe, it was a banqueting-place as well,
and the native birds were joined by roving outsiders,
missel-thrushes in scores, and starlings in hundreds.
The noise they produced&mdash;a tangle of so many
various semi-musical voices&mdash;sounded all day long;
and until the abundant fruit had all been devoured
the chalk pit was a gigantic green and white bowl full
to overflowing with sunshine, purple juice, and melody.
</p>

<p>
The biggest crop of this fruit, out of the old chalk
pit, was in the garden of a cottage in the village,
close to the river, occupied by an old married couple,
hard workers still with spade and hoe, and able to
make a Living by selling the produce of their garden.
It was a curious place; fruit trees and bushes, herbs,
vegetables, flowers, all growing mixed up anyhow,
without beds or walks or any line of demarcation
between cultivated plants and brambles and nettles
on either side and the flags and sedges at the lower
end by the river.  In the midst of the plot, just
visible among the greenery, stood the small, old,
low-roofed thatched cottage, where the hens were
free to go in and lay their eggs under the bed or
in any dark corner they preferred.  A group of seven
or eight old elder-trees grew close to the cottage,
their branches bent and hanging with the weight of
the purpling clusters.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with the fruit?" I
asked the old woman; and this innocent question
raised a tempest in her breast, for I had unwittingly
touched on a sore subject.

"Do!" she exclaimed rather fiercely, "I'm going
to do nothing with it!  I've made elderberry wine
years and years and years.  So did my mother;
so did my grandmother; so did everybody in my
time.  And very good it were, too, I tell 'e, in cold
weather in winter, made hot.  It warmed your inside.
But nobody wants it now, and nobody'll help me
with it.  How'm I to do it&mdash;keep the birds off and
all!  I've been fighting 'em years and years, and now
I can't do it no longer.  And what's the good of
doing it if the wine's not good enough for people
to drink?  Nothing's good enough now unless you
buys it in a public-house or a shop.  It wasn't so
when I were a girl.  We did everything for ourselves
then, and it were better, I tell 'e.  We kep' a pig
then&mdash;so did everyone; and the pork and bacon
it were good, not like what we buy now.  We put
it mostly in brine, and let it be for months; and
when we took it out and biled it, it were red as a
cherry and white as milk, and it melted just like
butter in your mouth.  That's what we ate in my
time.  But you can't keep a pig now&mdash;oh dear, no!
You don't have him more'n a day or two before the
sanitary man looks in.  He says he were passing and
felt a sort of smell about&mdash;would you mind letting
him come in just to have a sniff round?  He expects
it might be a pig you've got.  In my time we didn't
think a pig's smell hurt nobody.  They've got their
own smell, pigs have, same as dogs and everything
else.  But we've got very partickler about smells now.
</p>

<p>
"And we didn't drink no tea then.  Eight shillings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
a pound, or maybe seven-and-six&mdash;dear, dear, how
was we to buy it!  We had beer for breakfast and it
did us good.  It were better than all these nasty
cocoa stuffs we drink now.  We didn't buy it at
the public-house&mdash;we brewed it ourselves.  And we
had a brick oven then, and could put a pie in, and a
loaf, and whatever we wanted, and it were proper
vittals.  We baked barley bread, and black bread,
and all sorts of bread, and it did us good and made
us strong.  These iron ranges and stoves we have
now&mdash;what's the good o' they?  You can't bake bread
in 'em.  And the wheat bread you gits from the shop,
what's it good for?  'Tisn't proper vittals&mdash;it fills
'e with wind.  No, I say, I'm not going to git the
fruit&mdash;let the birds have it!  Just look at the greedy
things&mdash;them starlings!  I've shouted, and thrown
sticks and all sorts of things, and shaken a cloth
at 'em, and it's like calling the fowls to feed.  The
more noise I make the more they come.  What I
say is, If I can't have the fruit I wish the blackbirds
'ud git it.  People say to me, 'Oh, don't talk to me
about they blackbirds&mdash;they be the worst of all
for fruit.'  But I never minded that&mdash;because&mdash;well
I'll tell 'e.  I mind when I were a little thing at
Old Alresford, where I were born, I used to be up
at four in the morning, in summer, listening to the
blackbirds.  And mother she used to say, 'Lord,
how she do love to hear a blackbird!'  It's always
been the same.  I's always up at four, and in summer
I goes out to hear the blackbird when it do sing so
beautiful.  But them starlings that come messing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
about, pulling the straws out of the thatch, I've
no patience with they.  We didn't have so many
starlings when I were young.  But things is very
different now; and what I say is, I wish they wasn't&mdash;I
wish they was the same as when I were a girl.
And I wish I was a girl again."
</p>

<p>
Listening to this tirade on the degeneracy of
modern times, it amused me to recall the very
different feeling on the same subject expressed by
the old Wolmer Forest woman.  But the Itchen
woman had more vigour, more staying-power in her:
one could see it in the fresh colour in her round
face, and the pure colour and brightness of her
eyes&mdash;brighter and bluer than in most blue-eyed girls.
Altogether, she was one of the best examples of the
hard-headed, indomitable Saxon peasants I have
met with in the south of England.  She was past
seventy, impeded by an old infirmity, the mother
of many men and women with big families of their
own, all scattered far and wide over the county,&mdash;all
too poor themselves to help her in her old age,
or to leave their work and come such a distance to
see her, excepting when they were in difficulties,
for then they would come for what she could spare
them out of her hardly-earned little hoard.
</p>

<p>
I admired her "fierce volubility"; but that sudden
softening at the end about the blackbird's beautiful
voice, and that memory of her distant childhood,
and her wish, strange in these weary days,
to have her hard life to live over again, came as
a surprise to me.

Migration of swallows
</span>
</p>

<p>
In days like these, so bright and peaceful, one
thinks with a feeling of wonder that many of our
familiar birds are daily and nightly slipping away,
decreasing gradually in numbers, so that we scarcely
miss them.  By the middle of September the fly-catchers
and several of the warblers, all but a few
laggards, have left us.  Even the swallows begin to
leave us before that date.  On the 8th many birds
were congregated at a point on the river a little
above the village, and on the 10th a considerable
migration took place.  Near the end of a fine day
a big cloud came up from the north-west, and
beneath it, at a good height, the birds were seen
flying down the valley in a westerly direction.  I
went out and watched them for half an hour, standing
on the little wooden bridge that spans the stream.
They went by in flocks of about eighty to a couple
of hundred birds, flock succeeding flock at intervals
of three or four minutes.  By the time the sun set
the entire sky was covered by the black cloud, and
there was a thick gloom on the earth; it was then
some eight or ten minutes after the last flock, flying
high, had passed twittering on its way that a rush
of birds came by, flying low, about on a level with
my head as I stood leaning on the handrail of the
bridge.  I strained my eyes in vain to make out
what they were&mdash;swallows or martins&mdash;as in rapid
succession, and in twos and threes, they came before
me, seen vaguely as dim spots, and no sooner seen
than gone, shooting past my head with amazing
velocity and a rushing sound, fanning my face with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
the wind they created, and some of them touching
me with their wing-tips.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of 18th September a second migration
was witnessed at the same spot, flock succeeding
flock until it was nearly dark.  On the following
evening, at another point on the river at Ovington,
I witnessed a third and more impressive spectacle.
The valley spreads out there to a great width, and
has extensive beds of reeds, bulrushes, and other
water plants, with clumps and rows of alders and
willows.  It was growing dark; bats were flitting
round me in numbers, and the trees along the edge
of the valley looked black against the pale amber
sky in the west, when very suddenly the air overhead
became filled with a shrill confused noise, and,
looking up through my binocular, I saw at a
considerable height an immense body of swallows
travelling in a south-westerly direction.  A very
few moments after catching sight of them they
paused in their flight, and, after remaining a short
time at one point, looking like a great swarm of
bees, they began rushing wildly about, still keeping
up their shrill excited twittering, and coming lower
and lower by degrees; and finally, in batches of
two or three hundred birds, they rushed down like
lightning into the dark reeds, shower following
shower of swallows at intervals of two or three
seconds, until the last had vanished and the night
was silent again.
</p>

<p>
It was time for them to go, for though the days were
warm and food abundant, the nights were growing cold.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
</p>

<p>
The early hours are silent, except for the brown
owls that hoot round the cottage from about four
o'clock until dawn.  Then they grow silent, and the
morning is come, cold and misty, and all the land
is hidden by a creeping white river-mist.  The sun
rises, and is not seen for half an hour, then appears
pale and dim, but grows brighter and warmer by
degrees; and in a little while, lo! the mist has
vanished, except for a white rag, clinging like torn
lace here and there to the valley reeds and rushes.
Again, the green earth, wetted with mist and dews,
and the sky of that soft pure azure of yesterday and
of many previous days.  Again the birds are vocal;
the rooks rise from the woods, an innumerable cawing
multitude, their voices filling the heavens with noise
as they travel slowly away to their feeding-grounds
on the green open downs; the starlings flock to the
bushes, and the feasting and chatter and song begin
that will last until evening.  The sun sets crimson
and the robins sing in the night and silence.  But it
is not silent long; before dark the brown owls begin
hooting, first in the woods, then fly across to the
trees that grow beside the cottage, so that we may
the better enjoy their music.  At intervals, too we
hear the windy sibilant screech of the white owl
across the valley.  Then the wild cry of the

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
